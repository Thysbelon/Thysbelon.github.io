<h1 itemprop=headline>I Tried to Improve Nintendo DS Music Romhacking</h1>
<time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-11-27>27 November 2024</time>
<p>Hello! Over the last two months, I spent a lot of time improving <a href=https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2024-9-24/My-Attempts-to-Improve-GBA-Music-Romhacking-and-SiIva-Style-Ripping>my fork of GBA_Mus_Ripper</a>. I fixed bugs, made the outputted midi and sf2 sound more accurate to the GBA, made it compatible with more GBA games, and updated the documentation.
<p>Unless users find more bugs (I may not always fix bugs right away, but I always appreciate it when users inform me of bugs!), or that one infinite loop bug I found ends up affecting more songs than just the "Unknown Item Jingle" from Metroid: Zero Mission (Japan), GBA_Mus_Ripper is complete!
<p>With GBA_Mus_Ripper finished, I was curious to see if there was anything I could do to improve Nintendo DS music romhacking. 
<p>My main goals were to allow users to convert to and from sseq (DS sequenced music format) and midi mostly losslessly, inject these sseq files into a DS rom, and to do all this on Linux. That last goal was important to me, and I'm happy to say I achieved it. (all of these programs should work on Windows as well. Please politely let me know if they don't!)
<p>Keep in mind that all this hasn't been tested rigorously. I was able to extract a song from <i>Kirby: Canvas Curse</i>, modify it, then inject it back into the game and run it on <a href=https://melonds.kuribo64.net/ target=_blank>MelonDS 0.9.5</a>; but the song I tested didn't use many different sequence commands, so there could still be bugs that I missed. Politely letting me know about bugs in the issues tab on GitHub is always appreciated!

<h2 id=sseq2mid><a href=https://github.com/Thysbelon/sseq2mid target=_blank>sseq2mid</a></h2>
<p>This program was originally written by <a href=https://github.com/loveemu/loveemu-lab/tree/master/nds/sseq2mid target=_blank>loveemu</a>. It was the best simple sseq-to-midi program I could find, so I decided I would try to do my best to improve it. I went through the list of sseq commands, and implemented midi conversions for the sseq commands that didn't have them.
<p>Keep in mind that most of the midi conversions I implemented are completely inaudible in the exported midi. sseq has a lot of commands that don't have an equivalent in midi. One day, I might create a DS-sound-bank-2-sf2 converter that uses modulators to make these commands audible, but that won't be anytime soon because it would be a lot of work; the GBA_Mus_Ripper suite already had sound_font_ripper, a simple program that I could modify to add modulators to the soundfonts, but I don't think a simple DS-sound-bank-2-sf2 program currently exists that I could modify.
<p>The reason I implemented all these commands, even though they're inaudible in the midi, is because I designed my fork of midi2sseq to read these commands and convert them back to their sseq equivalent, preserving all of the effects used in the song.

<h2 id=midi2sseq><a href=https://github.com/Thysbelon/midi2sseq target=_blank>midi2sseq</a></h2>
<p>This program was originally written by <a href=https://github.com/fincs/midi2sseq target=_blank>fincs</a>. <a href=https://github.com/perallard/midi2sseq target=_blank>perallard made a fork</a> of fincs's program with a few improvements, so I decided to fork perallard's fork. Like with sseq2mid, I did my best to implement conversions for every sseq command.

<h2 id=SDATTool><a href=https://github.com/froggestspirit/SDATTool target=_blank>SDATTool</a></h2>
<p>I did not write this program, nor did I make any modifications to it. I am including it in this blog post because it's a very good program that allowed me to achieve my goal of injecting modified songs into DS games.
<p>SDATTool is a python3 program written by froggestspirit. It can both unpack and re-pack SDAT files. And because it's a python program, it can run on any platform that can run python!

<h2 id=ndstool><a href=https://wii.leseratte10.de/devkitPro/other-stuff/ndstool/ target=_blank>ndstool</a></h2>
<p>I also did not write or modify this program. ndstool is a program that can dump the files of a DS rom, then rebuild the rom with your modified files. The author is the organization <a href=https://devkitpro.org/ target=_blank>devkitPro</a>; they only provide this program as a bundle with the rest of their <a href=https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started target=_blank>great Nintendo DS software development toolchain</a>, but for people like SiIva-style-high-quality-rippers who just want to mess around with music, it's more convenient to just download one of the portable copies that Leseratte provides.
