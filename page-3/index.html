<p>Microsoft Forms responses can be downloaded as an Excel Spreadsheet; but the fields will often have unnecessary line breaks, which causes these fields' names to be discarded when importing the spreadsheet into an MS Access database.
</p><p>Remove line breaks:
</p><ol>
	<li>Open the Find &amp; Replace box
	</li><li>Click on the Find field and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> on your keyboard
	</li><li>Leave the Replace field blank
	</li><li>Click "Replace All"
	</li><li>Save your workbook
	</li><li>Close and reopen Excel. This is necessary because Excel will automatically fill the Find field with whatever was last used, and it is impossible to delete line break characters from the Find field, so Find will be broken until Excel is restarted.
</li></ol>

<p>Emamouse's songs for ItemLabel use a lot of complex harmonies that remind me of the classical piano music I've been playing lately. The song "Peepy's Secret" has a lot of buzzing sound effects that make the song trippy and surreal, but it also makes the notes a little hard to hear; so to understand the song better, I decided to transcribe a midi version of it. I didn't finish transcribing the end of the song because I was getting a bit tired, but I hope you still find my midi useful. Feel free to download this <a href="peepy's-secret-almost-finished.mid">Peepy's Secret midi</a> and adapt it into sheet music or reference it for covers (credit to me would be appreciated).
</p><p>This transcription would not have been possible without <a href="https://vocalremover.org/splitter-ai" target="_blank">this stem splitter AI</a> and <a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/emamouse/peepys-secret" target="_blank">this transcription of the chords and melody of the verse and chorus by mathyfurret</a>. If you plan on finishing this midi, please <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/hvy6r0pb95xl8ot/20210926_Peepy%2527s_Secret%255Brebalanced%255D.7z/file" target="_blank">download the stems I split with the AI</a>.
</p><p>As I was writing this post, I just realized that the entire time I was transcribing the song, I accidently had all the stems set to a bass-boosted EQ. <a href="/Blog/2024-4-14/Peepy's-Secret-Midi-(Almost-Finished)" tabindex="-1"><img src="/emoji/😅.svg" alt="😅" width="128" style="--natural-width: 128; --natural-height: 128;" height="128"></a>

<p>With Persona 3 Reload having released recently, and "The Answer" being announced as DLC for it last March, the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--FtBd-RiKA" target="_blank">"Heartful Cry"</a> was on my mind and I decided to listen to it again.
<br>As I was listening, I thought "in a 2A03 chiptune cover of this song, that <a href="https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2023-11-16/Pac-Man-Championship-and-Blaster-Master-Area-4-Game-Over-Ribbit-Triangle-Effect">triangle linear counter effect</a> would make for a great instrument to represent the harsh bass lead in the original".
<br>So, I made that 2A03 chiptune cover!
</p><p>I used Furnace tracker, because FamiStudio doesn't support the triangle counter effect. I started making the cover on the weekend, March 16th. I worked on it for hours each day to get it done before my next class, and finished on March 18th.
</p><p>I also uploaded a video to my YouTube channel of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYmPZVayAQ" target="_blank">oscilloscope view of the cover</a>!
</p><h2>Introducing Web-Chiptune-Player</h2>
<p>Remember when I made a <a href="https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2023-3-13/Murders-(Hawaii-Part-II)-VRC6-Chiptune-Cover">chiptune cover of Murders</a>, but didn't post it on my blog until I finished coding an NSF player? I've done the same thing again! Currently, the only chiptune format that Furnace can export Famicom chiptunes to is VGM; so I couldn't use Web-NSF-Player or Web-GME-Player for this post. I had been experimenting with making more web players for more chiptune formats for a while, but making this VGM format cover motivated me to finally release a usable multi-format, multi-library web chiptune player. There are more features I would like to add, but I think Web-Chiptune-Player is in a good state right now.
</p><p>The purpose of Web-Chiptune-Player is to allow web developers to embed chiptune in their websites, as I have done in this very post; if that sounds interesting to you, then I hope you'll find <a href="https://github.com/Thysbelon/Web-Chiptune-Player" target="_blank">Web-Chiptune-Player</a> useful! <a href="/Blog/2024-4-6/Heartful-Cry-(Persona-3)-2A03-Cover-(and-Web-Chiptune-Player)" tabindex="-1"><img src="/emoji/😊.svg" alt="😊" width="128" style="--natural-width: 128; --natural-height: 128;" height="128"></a>

<p>I was watching <a href="https://youtu.be/M5bbFWluURk?t=8844" target="_blank">Snapcube's stream of Insomniac's Spider-Man</a>, and I noticed that MJ's camera looked very familiar. In fact, it's almost exactly the same as my camera: the Panasonic Lumix LX100 II!</p>

<p>This reveals another little detail: MJ takes photos with the flash on in this mission, but her camera doesn't have the flash module attached! Hmm, her camera must have been modified to add an in-body flash.

			<p>I spent about two weeks migrating my website from Jekyll to Eleventy. Jekyll is probably very good for simple websites, but I added a lot of complicated features to my website, so the Liquid code was a mess. Now that all that complicated code is in JavaScript, I feel like it'll be much easier to maintain.
</p><p>I'm not sure I can write a good post about my experiences, so I'll just make a big list of tips and links. (make sure...
