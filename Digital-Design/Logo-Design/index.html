<h2>Logo Design</h2>
<p>To create a logo that embodies the idea of Responsible Consumption and Production, I was first tasked to trace five silhouettes from photos relating to that theme in <span>Adobe Illustrator</span>. The photos I chose are all objects that were mentioned <a href=..#Interviews>by my interviewees</a>. Below each silhouette is the word that I believe each silhouette communicates.</p>
<div class="gallery fs">
<div><img src=earth.svg alt=Earth><p>TOGETHER</p></div>
<div><img src=penrose.svg alt="The Penrose stairs"><p>PROGRESS</p></div>
<div><img src=balloon.svg alt=Balloon><p>RISING</p></div>
<div><img src=barn.svg alt=Barn><p>HARMONY WITH EARTH</p></div>
<div><img src=forest.svg alt=Forest><p>NATURE</p></div>
</div>
<p>Afterwards, I designed five logo concepts. I had fun experimenting with type, and I tried to consider the tone that each font would give off. I think I'll use either a <span style="font:1.2em serif;">serif</span> font to show elegance and professionalism, or a <span style=font-family:sans-serif;><b>bold</b></span> font to show how serious the non-profit is about protecting the planet.</p><div class=gallery>
<img src=2.svg><img src=5.svg><img src=7.svg><img src=8.svg><img src=9.svg><img src=10.svg>
</div><p>I used mainly the earth and the penrose stairs because I felt that they best represented the idea of progressing with human development in harmony with the earth. The first design, with the earth inside the C, is very strong, but I feel like it's already been done hundreds of times before, so I didn't pursue that idea. When I started combining the Earth and Penrose stairs, I, at first, wanted to have this logo be just an image, with the text underneath, but then I played with the idea of having small letters in the globe.</p><div class=gallery>
<img src=11.svg>
<img src=12.svg>
<img src=13.svg>
<img src=16.svg>
<img src=19.svg>
</div><p>I realized that the small letters wouldn't be visible when the image was small, so I tried making the letters bigger, then I realized I could make them even bigger if I arranged them to fit in the negative space of the globe. I also simplified the stairs a little bit and switched around the positive and negative space after receiving feedback that I should do so.</p><div class=gallery>
<img src=21.svg>
<img src=23.svg>
</div><p>I then started to wonder if this logo would even be appealing to the target audience, or if it at all communicated what the fictional non-profit would be like, so I went back to the bold letters with the penrose stairs in the C, and I made it red to represent anger towards those who harm the planet. I then had the idea to put a different symbol in each letter, a set of arrows, the stairs, and the earth. The C is much wider that it is tall, so I made the other letters taller than the C so they would all be the same size and it would feel balanced. I positioned the R and the P close to the C and had them wrap around it in order to make the design feel like one cohesive whole instead of three separate letters. I positioned the C slightly lower than the baseline, thinking that this would make it a focal point and make the design more interesting.</p>
<div class=gallery>

</div><p>My professor suggested some changes to this design. She said to remove some of the white lines around the earth, make the C as tall as the other letters, space the letters farther apart, and position them all on the baseline. She also said to make the shape around the stairs a perfect half circle. I was unable to do this, because a half circle is not wide enough to cover the left half of the stairs, so I instead made it more of an oval shape. For the subtitle, I chose <a href=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Julius+Sans+One target=_blank>Julius Sans One</a>. The thinness and lack of serifs contrast this font to the one used in the main logo. Details of this font, such as the curve to the R, give the font a hint of elegance. The rigid, small caps style keeps the serious tone intact.</p>

</div><p>I had two other ideas on how I could make the C more clear, and I wanted to draw them out.</p>
