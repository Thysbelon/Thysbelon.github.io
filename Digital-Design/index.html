			<h2>Sustainable Theme</h2>
			<p>A sustainable theme is a goal to further the wellbeing of our planet and the people living on it. Many non-profit organizations will design their branding after the sustainable theme that they are working towards.</p>
			<p>For my sustainable theme, I have chosen</p>
			<h2>Responsible Consumption and Production</h2>
			<p>This theme is meaningful to me because most of the power over what happens to our planet is held by a few megacorporations. Individual actions such as saving water are unlikely to make a difference when large factories dump gallons of waste into the ocean simply because it is the cheapest way to dispose of it. The only way to truly make a difference is to hold these companies accountable, and reform the economic system that led to all this waste in the first place.</p>
