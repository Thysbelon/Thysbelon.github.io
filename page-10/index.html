			<p>On November 6th 2021, Did You Know Gaming uploaded a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esIL1W_QBns target=_blank>video about the origins of Mew</a>. This video made me aware of an <a href=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train-225842.html target=_blank>Iwata Asks interview with GameFreak published after the release of HeartGold and SoulSilver</a>. They began by talking about how the Pokémon series became popular. Ishihara said that Mew <q>played an extremely significant role</q> in the first pair of games' rise to fame.

The first ad has a greyscale photo of two adults kissing. The second ad has large text that says: Quite possibly the only thing weirder than your sister."></a></a><p>I just finished my marketing course, which was required for my itech degree. I've always been wary of business, so I was worried that I wouldn't "get" marketing at all. I had no idea what to write in my paper... then I remembered something that gave me confidence; these advertisements.<p>Someone was paid to come up with these.<p>So, no matter how little I know about marketing, I still know more than these paid designers who worked for a prominent game company, so I think that's a pretty good accomplishment. <img src=/emoji/😊.svg alt=😊>

I thought that I would do very well at the quiz, because of how many Kirby songs I know, but I only got 66%. Then I wondered, &ldquo;Are all of these Kirby songs actually real?&rdquo; To satisfy my curiosity, I tracked down the source of every song title myself. I made the mistake of doing this before checking to see if...

<p>I've never been that big of a fan of most emoji. Apple popularized the the use of gradients in emoji, but I think it just looks <em>so</em> ugly <img src=/emoji/😕.svg alt=😕>. Gradients look nice in a background, but the moment they're put into a character design they just look tacky. The reason I like flat colors so much is because they don't have any ugly gradients, they're easy to draw<img src=/emoji/✏.svg alt=✏>, and they're easy to read at small sizes <img src=/emoji/🙋.svg alt=🙋>.<p>Lots of emoji use...
