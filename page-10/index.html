<p>I've never been that big of a fan of most emoji. Apple popularized the the use of gradients in emoji, but I think it just looks <em>so</em> ugly <img src=/emoji/😕.svg alt=😕>. Gradients look nice in a background, but the moment they're put into a character design they just look tacky. The reason I like flat colors so much is because they don't have any ugly gradients, they're easy to draw<img src=/emoji/✏.svg alt=✏>, and they're easy to read at small sizes <img src=/emoji/🙋.svg alt=🙋>.<p>Lots of emoji use...

I first clicked "create outlines" so I could move the individual digits around. I knew there had to be a tool to space them automatically, but I didn't know where it was or how to use it. Following a guide I found online titled <a href=https://maschituts.com/how-to-evenly-space-objects-in-illustrator/ target=_blank>"How to Evenly Space Objects in Illustrator"</a>, I selected my objects, then clicked "Horizontal Distribute Space" in the Align window.<br>Nothing happened. I tried again and again; Did I select the objects wrong<!--in the wrong way-->? Eventually, on a whim, I decided to ungroup the objects. It worked perfectly. Illustrator has good tools, but it's frustrating when they're so unintuitive.

I changed the tags, categories, navbar, related posts, and archive to list elements, to make them better for screen readers. I also adjusted the color palette of my website to meet the WCAG AA accessibility guidelines. I'm happy I was able to come up with a color scheme that is both more accessible, and is prettier than the one I had before.</p>

<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land released last friday, and it's a lot of fun so far. I love the flat color, monochromatic graphics that display during the level loading screens. I've spoken before about how I like flat colors. <a href=https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-when-someone-refers-to-a-flat-color-What-is-the-difference-from-a-non-flat-color?share=1 target=_blank>The definition of a "flat color"</a> appears to be a color with no shading, texture, gradation, or halftones at all. The kind of colors I like fit the definition of flat color, but I'm okay with a bit of texture or...

<p>Out of the new games I've played recently (which isn't that many), <a href=http://donutcounty.com/ target=_blank>Donut County</a> probably has my favorite art direction. While playing it, I realized that it has many of the design points that I mentioned liking in <a href=placeholder>"Talking About My Inspirations"</a>. It uses simple shapes with flat pastel colors. The pastel very nicely communicates its status as a relaxing game. The UI uses a color that appears to be black, but is actually a dark, desaturated blue, making it...
