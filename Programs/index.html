<p>This is where I'll put any games or applications I've programmed.
<h2><a href="https://thysbelon.github.io/rhythm-heaven-web/holeinone 1.8 - 2.html">Rhythm Heaven Web Port Demo</a></h2>
<p>I think I'm the kind of person who feels more motivated to learn when I know the <em>use</em> of the thing I'm learning. That's why I decided to learn Javascript by attempting to port Rhythm Heaven Fever (Wii) to the web.
<p>All art and sound effects are pulled from Rhythm Heaven Fever (Wii).
<p>There is also a small <a href="https://thysbelon.github.io/rhythm-heaven-web/canvas-animation-demo/golfer layout anim3 script tag.html">Rhythm Heaven Fever Canvas Animation Demo</a>. I planned to incorporate this animation system into the main demo, but I abandoned the project before that happened. Unlike the main demo, which uses a hand-made css spritesheet of the characters' poses, and has placeholder bad animation timing; this animation demo uses animation and sprite data from Rhythm Heaven Fever, extracted using <a href=https://github.com/rhmodding/bread target=_blank>Bread</a>.
