<p>Hello! <img src=/emoji/ðŸ™‹.svg alt=ðŸ™‹><br>Recently, I discovered a very cool web port of Taiko no Tatsujin called <a href=https://taiko.bui.pm target=_blank>"Taiko Web"</a>. You can play both official charts and custom charts on it! It inspired me to make <a href=vista.zip>my own custom chart of "... Vista"</a>. I don't have much experience with making charts, so it's probably rough, but I enjoyed making it and I wanted to share it. Currently, there is an Oni difficulty and a Hard difficulty. I may tweak the chart at a later date to improve it, such as by making the Hard difficulty easier or adding a normal difficulty.<p>

<p>Watch out for this SplatHex bug! Even though octoglasses' main ability is last-ditch effort, SplatHex shows damage up as the main ability! <strong>This is purely a display bug</strong>, and all gears' main ability will always be correct in-game.

			<p>On November 6th 2021, Did You Know Gaming uploaded a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esIL1W_QBns target=_blank>video about the origins of Mew</a>. This video made me aware of an <a href=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train-225842.html target=_blank>Iwata Asks interview with GameFreak published after the release of HeartGold and SoulSilver</a>. They began by talking about how the PokÃ©mon series became popular. Ishihara said that Mew <q>played an extremely significant role</q> in the first pair of games' rise to fame. Morimoto then stated:<blockquote>due to an unforeseen bug, Mew ended up appearing in some playersâ€™ games....

The first ad has a greyscale photo of two adults kissing. The second ad has large text that says: Quite possibly the only thing weirder than your sister."></a></a><p>I just finished my marketing course, which was required for my itech degree. I've always been wary of business, so I was worried that I wouldn't "get" marketing at all. I had no idea what to write in my paper... then I remembered something that gave me confidence; these advertisements.<p>Someone was paid to come up with these.<p>So, no matter how little I know about marketing, I still know more than these paid designers who worked for a prominent game company, so I think that's a pretty good accomplishment. <img src=/emoji/ðŸ˜Š.svg alt=ðŸ˜Š>
