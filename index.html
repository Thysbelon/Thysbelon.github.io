<p>Many non-profit organizations stick to paper records because they don't have the budget to transition to digital. 
<p>Paper records are like open source software in that anyone can use them without needing to pay for a subscription, or worry about a company shutting down their service. In order for every organization in the world to switch to digital, there needs to be a suite of open source software that can fulfill all their transitional, record-keeping, and data entry needs; only open source software can compete with the ease of paper.

<p>You may have heard of active styluses, which have lots of features and are battery operated; but did you know that styluses for capacitive touchscreens can be simple and inexpensive? Passive styluses do nothing except conduct the electricity from your finger to the tip of the stylus, so they work with almost any touchscreen and don't need to be charged.
<p>I learned this thanks to <a href=https://kommandotech.com/guides/what-is-a-stylus-pen/ target=_blank>Kommando Tech's article "What Is a Stylus Pen and How It Works"</a>. Please read their article if you want more information.

<p>With Google getting worse and worse lately, it's helpful to use at least two different search engines. I use both <a href=https://duckduckgo.com target=_blank>DuckDuckGo</a> (which shares results with Bing) and occansionally Google when the former fails.
<p>There's also this <a href=https://s-n-arly.tumblr.com/post/690225102062764032/skip-google-for-research target=_blank>list of academic alternatives to Google compiled by Edward Clark</a>. I haven't used any of these, but you may find them interesting. <br>
When I do academic research I usually use <a href=https://www.jstor.org target=_blank>JSTOR</a>, but most of their articles are locked behind the need for a school account or payment.
<p>I've also heard of <a href=https://search.marginalia.nu/ target=_blank>search.marginalia.nu</a>. According to its creator, it's not designed to answer questions, but to show you websites you didn't know existed.

			<time datetime=2024-04-23 >23 April 2024</time>
			<a href=/Blog/2024-4-23/How-to-Remove-Line-Breaks-in-Excel tabindex=-1><img src=/Blog/2024-4-23/Microsoft_Office_Excel_(2019–present).svg class="restrictsize fri" style=--w:10rem></a>
<p>Microsoft Forms responses can be downloaded as an Excel Spreadsheet; but the fields will often have unnecessary line breaks, which causes these fields' names to be discarded when importing the spreadsheet into an MS Access database.
<p>Remove line breaks:
<ol>
	<li>Open the Find &amp; Replace box
	<li>Click on the Find field and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> on your keyboard
	<li>Leave the Replace field blank
	<li>Click "Replace All"
	<li>Save your workbook
	<li>Close and reopen Excel. This is necessary because Excel will automatically fill the Find field with whatever was last used, and it is impossible to delete line break characters from the Find field, so Find will be broken until Excel is restarted.
</ol>
