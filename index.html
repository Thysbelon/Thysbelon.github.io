			<time datetime=2024-11-27 >27 November 2024</time>
			<p>Hello! Over the last two months, I spent a lot of time improving <a href=https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2024-9-24/My-Attempts-to-Improve-GBA-Music-Romhacking-and-SiIva-Style-Ripping>my fork of GBA_Mus_Ripper</a>. I fixed bugs, made the outputted midi and sf2 sound more accurate to the GBA, made it compatible with more GBA games, and updated the documentation.
<p>Unless users find more bugs (I may not always fix bugs right away, but I always appreciate it when users inform me of bugs!), or that one infinite loop bug I found ends up affecting more songs than...

			<time datetime=2024-09-24 >24 September 2024</time>
			<p>(Whenever I talk about "ripping" in the below post, I am referring to a <a href=https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/Rip target=_blank>style of mashup made popular by SiIvagunner</a>.)
<p>Hello! Working on <a href=/Blog/2024-8-30/You-Can-Use-FamiStudio-to-Make-High-Quality-Rips>my last post</a> made me think about how, even though GBA ripping is very easy and reliable especially compared to other consoles, the process could still be improved. For example, GBA_Mus_Ripper has a bug that causes the generated soundfonts to sound horrible in fluidsynth, and it often adds vibrato to songs that aren't supposed to have vibrato.

			<time datetime=2024-08-30 >30 August 2024</time>
			<p>Many guides on how to create <a href=https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/Rip target=_blank>SiIvagunner-style "high quality rips"</a> for Famicom/NES games state to use <a href=http://famitracker.com/ target=_blank>FamiTracker</a>. A "tracker" is an unconventional music editor in which notes are typed into rows of text.
<br>Did you know that a more conventional side-scrolling music editor for Famicom music exists? It is <a href=https://famistudio.org target=_blank>FamiStudio</a>.
<p>In FamiStudio, you can import <a href=https://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=NSF target=_blank>NSF or NSFe files</a> containing chiptune music, and then freely edit the chiptune music.
<p><a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dka7s2sbwuJuTcs3BxupaXlTWERYuCwPNQi2_HwpGfs/ target=_blank>overcast07's guide "Obtaining sources for creating a high quality rip"</a>, which is one of many helpful documents that the <a href=https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/Ripping target=_blank>"Ripping" page of the SiIvagunner Wiki</a> links to, also mentions that FamiStudio can be used to create rips. 
<br>He states that rips created in FamiStudio should be exported as NSF then rendered to an audio file using Game Emu Player and foobar2000, because FamiStudio's audio export has "substandard accuracy".
<br>overcast07 stopped updating this document in February 2024, so FamiStudio's audio export may have improved since then; 
<br>but if you wish to try this method, I believe the "download WAV" button on my <a href=/Web-Chiptune-Player/demo.html>Web-Chiptune-Player demo page</a> should render NSF files with the same accuracy as foobar2000 and Game Emu Player because they are both built off of the <a href=https://github.com/libgme/game-music-emu target=_blank>Game_Music_Emu</a> library; please export an NSFe file from FamiStudio so Web-Chiptune-Player knows how many seconds of audio to render!

			<h1><a href=/Blog/2024-7-31/Kirby-Canvas-Curse-Music-May-Be-IDM>Kirby Canvas Curse Music May Be IDM</a></h1>
			<time datetime=2024-07-31 >31 July 2024</time>
			<p>I love the aesthetics of <i>Kirby: Canvas Curse</i>. One might think that a game about travelling into a world of paintings would have an art style matching the Renaissance or Impressionism, and have orchestral music; but Canvas Curse embodies the true spirit of art: experimentation. The user interface is geometric abstraction, sprites of characters appear to be pre-rendered 3d, and the art style of the level background changes constantly from level to level.
<p>The music is electronic; but while most electronic music may have a focus on bass and sawtooths, Canvas Curse focuses on high pitch, tinny, slightly wet sounds (reminiscent of water splashing and bubbling).
<br>I haven't heard much music like it (though I don't often go out of my way to listen to new music). However, there's one song I've heard that strongly reminds me of Canvas Curse's music: <a href=https://patriciataxxon.bandcamp.com/track/techdog target=_blank>TECHDOG by Patricia Taxxon</a> from the album <a href=https://patriciataxxon.bandcamp.com/album/techdog-1 target=_blank>TECHDOG 1</a>. TECHDOG is very different from Canvas Curse music, it's much more atonal for example, but the instruments have that tinniness and wetness. Patricia Taxxon is very good at making intricate and lovely soundscapes.
<br>TECHDOG 1 is tagged as "IDM" and "Glitch" on Bandcamp. Maybe the Canvas Curse soundtrack can also be described as IDM? Most of Canvas Curse's music doesn't fall into the Glitch genre, except for Drawcia Soul.
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this post. I recommend <a href=https://patriciataxxon.bandcamp.com/album/techdog-1-7 target=_blank>listening to the TECHDOG anthology</a>, it's very good. Have a nice day <a href=/Blog/2024-7-31/Kirby-Canvas-Curse-Music-May-Be-IDM tabindex=-1><img src=/emoji/ðŸ˜ƒ.svg alt="ðŸ˜ƒ"></a>.

<p>Whenever I notice a vague similarity between two songs, I add them to a list of mashup ideas. I was looking back at old entries in my list, and I saw "Beginning of Tera Raid Battle X Beginning of Untamed Heart". I wrote this entry before hearing the Area Zero theme, and upon reading it again I realized that Area Zero and Untamed Heart might go quite well together. I made a little musical sketch in <a href=https://signal.vercel.app/ target=_blank>Signal</a> of how a mashup of these two songs might sound; I'll probably never finish it, but I hope you enjoy it. If you want to, feel free to take this idea and finish it (credit to me would be appreciated). <a href=untamed-heart-X-area-zero-4.mid>Download midi</a>. The soundfont I used is <a href=https://github.com/denemo/denemo/blob/master/soundfonts/A320U.sf2 target=_blank>A320U.sf2</a>, the default soundfont in Signal midi editor.
<p>Thank you to <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9RG4LvL0E&lc=Ugy4NJqX-aZypm6lE_V4AaABAg target=_blank>YouTube@cactusowo1835 for Untamed Heart's chords</a>, and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61_WIElP1Xc target=_blank>bran for the visualizer in his Area Zero cover that shows the chords</a>.
