			<time datetime=2024-02-23 >23 February 2024</time>
			<p>I spent about two weeks migrating my website from Jekyll to Eleventy. Jekyll is probably very good for simple websites, but I added a lot of complicated features to my website, so the Liquid code was a mess. Now that all that complicated code is in JavaScript, I feel like it'll be much easier to maintain.
<p>I'm not sure I can write a good post about my experiences, so I'll just make a big list of tips and links. (make sure...

			<time datetime=2023-11-28 >28 November 2023</time>
			<p><a href=https://squarewave.neocities.org/ target=_blank>SquareWave</a> has a <a href=https://youtu.be/0OVX7diOP9I target=_blank>2A03 song that showcases a cool effect</a> that can be achieved by playing two square waves with the same notes at the same time, with the first's waveform set to 25% duty, and the second's set to <em>-25%</em><!--test_screenreader--> duty. This effect is called the "pseudofilter" (at least, that's what the comments call it) because of how its tinny, needly waveform resembles the sound of a 50% square wave run through a high pass filter. The basic steps...

			<time datetime=2023-11-16 >16 November 2023</time>
			<p><!--to do: put links to my yt uploads of these songs when I upload them--><a href=https://youtu.be/kiVtR-XF7h4?t=64 target=_blank>Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version's Normal Mode music</a> and Blaster Master's Area 4 and Game Over themes all use this interesting effect in the Famicom/NES's 2A03's triangle channel. <br>In Blaster Master, it sounds like a ribbit; calling to mind the main goal of this game: to rescue the protagonist's pet frog Fred. <br>In Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version, it sounds like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house target=_blank>overdriven synthesizers that one typically hears in acid music</a>. 
<p>These are both created using the same feature: the triangle's linear counter. By setting the linear counter to a low value between 1 and 3, it causes the triangle to pulse (mute and unmute itself) very quickly instead of sustaining a single note. Though it is not possible at the moment to create this effect in FamiStudio, it <em>is</em> possible in <a href=https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace>Furnace Tracker</a> using effect <code>19xx</code>. Here is a <a href=famicom-overdrive-triangle.fur>sample Furnace project file that shows this triangle effect</a>.

<p>In August, I was listening to Tim Follin's work. When I listened to <i>Chronos</i> on youtube, the suggested videos were for other <span lang=en-GB>ZX Spectrum</span> beeper music, such as <a href=https://soundcloud.com/mister_beep/mister-beep-rubber-love-zx48 target=_blank><i>Rubber Love</i> by Mister Beep</a>. I was blown away! I had thought that Tim Follin getting 5 tinny voices out of the one channel beeper was the peak of what one could do, but Rubber Love had a full sound to it! I listened to a lot of <span lang=en-GB>ZX Spectrum</span> beeper...
