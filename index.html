			<p><a href="/Blog/2026-2-27/BANK_NIJI_all_4.sf2" download="">Download the Kirby: Canvas Curse / Power Paintbrush All Instruments Soundfont</a>
</p><p>I used VGMTrans 1.3 (the latest version as of writing this) to convert all of the sound banks in Kirby: Canvas Curse to Soundfont, then I used the Soundfont editor Polyphone to copy and paste every instrument from every soundfont into one soundfont.
</p><p>This soundfont should work with every song in the game (except the AGBK songs, which are copied from previous Kirby games). This soundfont should also make it easier to make arrangements in the style of Kirby: Canvas Curse.
</p><p>Because I just used copy and paste to combine the instruments, there shouldn't be any reduction in quality.

			<time datetime="2025-08-12">12 August 2025</time>
			<p>It always seemed strange to me that the most popular way for music mashup artists to modify Game Boy music is to import it into FamiTracker, a program that is designed for Famicom music, <em>not</em> Game Boy music!
</p><p>At first, I considered just modifying the program that people were already using, as I have done many times in the past. I noticed that this program converted Game Boy APU register writes into FamiTracker commands; but the fact that it just converted right from one format to another, and the fact that the Game Boy registers were unlabeled in the code, would have made it difficult to modify.
</p><p>So I decided to make my own program, to convert Game Boy APU register writes into an editable format.
</p><p>At first, I converted the Game Boy music into Furnace tracker files, because Furnace already has a Game Boy sound synthesis engine.
</p><p>However, after I finished the program, I realized that a tracker format was a suboptimal format to convert to.
</p><p>In order to be easy to work with, a tracker file shouldn't play any faster than 60 rows per second; but many Game Boy songs have effects happening faster than 60 times a second. This made songs sound very inaccurate after being converted.
</p><p>In order to convert the songs accurately, I had to use midi. Thus, I created <a href="https://github.com/Thysbelon/gbs2midi">gbs2midi</a>.
</p><p>And, in order to synthesize the midi, I created <a href="https://thysbelon.github.io/Nelly-GB-synth/">Nelly GB</a>.
</p><p>I hope you find my programs useful. <a href="/Blog/2025-8-12/Perfecting-the-Modification-of-Game-Boy-Music" tabindex="-1"><img src="/emoji/😊.svg" alt="😊" width="128" style="--natural-width: 128; --natural-height: 128;" height="128"></a>

<p>Hello!
</p><p>I enjoyed my Christmas. I took a little break from programming to spend time with family, and bake sweets!
</p><p>This year, I wanted to bake a Yule Log, but the whole rolling process felt too fussy, and I wanted the sponge cake and whipped cream filling to be more flavorful without just turning it into a chocolate cake.
<br>So I decided to take a <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/buche-de-noel-yule-log/" target="_blank">standard Yule Log recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction</a> and modify it! I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the...

			<time datetime="2024-11-27">27 November 2024</time>
			<p>Hello! Over the last two months, I spent a lot of time improving <a href="https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2024-9-24/My-Attempts-to-Improve-GBA-Music-Romhacking-and-SiIva-Style-Ripping">my fork of GBA_Mus_Ripper</a>. I fixed bugs, made the outputted midi and sf2 sound more accurate to the GBA, made it compatible with more GBA games, and updated the documentation.
</p><p>Unless users find more bugs (I may not always fix bugs right away, but I always appreciate it when users inform me of bugs!), or that one infinite loop bug I found ends up affecting more songs than...

			<time datetime="2024-09-24">24 September 2024</time>
			<p>(Whenever I talk about "ripping" in the below post, I am referring to a <a href="https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/Rip" target="_blank">style of mashup made popular by SiIvagunner</a>.)
</p><p>Hello! Working on <a href="/Blog/2024-8-30/You-Can-Use-FamiStudio-to-Make-High-Quality-Rips">my last post</a> made me think about how, even though GBA ripping is very easy and reliable especially compared to other consoles, the process could still be improved. For example, GBA_Mus_Ripper has a bug that causes the generated soundfonts to sound horrible in fluidsynth, and it often adds vibrato to songs that aren't supposed to have vibrato.
