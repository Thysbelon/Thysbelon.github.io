I first clicked "create outlines" so I could move the individual digits around. I knew there had to be a tool to space them automatically, but I didn't know where it was or how to use it. Following a guide I found online titled <a href=https://maschituts.com/how-to-evenly-space-objects-in-illustrator/ target=_blank>"How to Evenly Space Objects in Illustrator"</a>, I selected my objects, then clicked "Horizontal Distribute Space" in the Align window.<br>Nothing happened. I tried again and again; Did I select the objects wrong? Eventually, on a whim, I decided to ungroup the objects. It worked perfectly. Illustrator has good tools, but it's frustrating when they're so unintuitive. </section> <div class=tags>Tags:<ul><li><a href=/Tags/Illustrator rel=tag>Illustrator</a><li><a href=/Tags/Guides rel=tag>Guides</a></ul></div> <div class=tags>Categories:<ul><li><a href=/Categories/Digital-Design rel=category>Digital Design</a></ul></div> </main> <aside> <h2>Related Posts</h2><ul class="gallery padb"> <li><a href=/2022/04/09/Android-5.0-Lollipop-the-Best-Emoji> Android 5.0 Lollipop: the Best Emoji<br> <p>I've never been that big of a fan of most emoji.
