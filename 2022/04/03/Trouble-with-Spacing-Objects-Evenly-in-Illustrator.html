<h1 itemprop=headline>Trouble with Spacing Objects Evenly in Illustrator</h1>
<time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2022-04-03> 3 April 2022</time>
<img itemprop=image src=thumb.png class=fri alt="A hawkmoth sitting in front of a computer and looking frustrated."><p>Today, I was working on the <a href=/Digital-Design/Social-Media/#Social-Media-Ads>social media ads for RCP</a> and I needed to space out the numbers in "1,500,000,000". I first clicked "create outlines" so I could move the individual digits around. I knew there had to be a tool to space them automatically, but I didn't know where it was or how to use it. Following a guide I found online titled <a href=https://maschituts.com/how-to-evenly-space-objects-in-illustrator/ target=_blank>"How to Evenly Space Objects in Illustrator"</a>, I selected my objects, then clicked "Horizontal Distribute Space" in the Align window.<br>Nothing happened. I tried again and again; Did I select the objects wrong<!--in the wrong way-->? Eventually, on a whim, I decided to ungroup the objects. It worked perfectly. Illustrator has good tools, but it's frustrating when they're so unintuitive.
