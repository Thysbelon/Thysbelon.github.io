<h1 itemprop=headline>The Origin Of Every Kirby Song on the Kirby or Touhou Song Title Quiz</h1>
<time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2022-04-16>16 April 2022</time>
<img itemprop=image class="restrictsize fri" style=--w:400px src=thumb.png alt="Kirby and Reimu. Kirby is wearing Reimu's ribbon and holding her gohei. Reimu is holding the star rod."><p>Last week, I came across a <a href=https://www.sporcle.com/games/SYZekrom/Kirby-or-Touhou-music-track-names target=_blank>quiz that asks the quizzee, "Is this song title from Kirby or Touhou?"</a>. I thought that I would do very well at the quiz, because of how many Kirby songs I know, but I only got 66%. Then I wondered, &ldquo;Are all of these Kirby songs actually real?&rdquo; To satisfy my curiosity, I tracked down the source of every song title myself. I made the mistake of doing this before checking to see if anyone else had done the same thing, as the creator already made a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPdcApmwnl8DJoxsi1vrJFQiSfzroC2D target=_blank>playlist of every song on the quiz</a>. Posting this now may seem pointless, however, I have two good reasons for doing so.<ol><li>This is my blog and I can post whatever I want here.<li>I didn't want the time I spent on this to go to waste.</ol><p>What I learned from my research is that the titles of the songs are changed to make them harder to recognize. For the Touhou songs, it seems this was done in a simple way. Most Touhou song titles are formatted "First Subtitle ~ Second Subtitle"; keeping this format intact would make the Touhou songs too easy to recognize, so the titles were split in half. The naming scheme for the Kirby songs, however, is <em>much</em> more convoluted. Kirby is a video game series, so many of its songs don't receive names until the game's soundtrack is released in an album; and because kirby is a Japanese franchise, many of those albums only release in Japan. So, many of the Kirby songs are translations of the Japanese titles. Even the songs that have official english names use unofficial translations instead; the author states this is to keep them in line with the Touhou song titles, which are all unofficial translations. This, alone, wouldn't be much of an issue. Kirby fans are used to calling songs by an unofficial translation; and for every song without an official one, there is usually a common unofficial title that the fans agree upon. The thing that makes the Kirby titles in this quiz so unfair to guess, however, is that they are referred to with <a href=https://syzekrom.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Kirby_Series target=_blank>names that only the author of the quiz has ever used</a> for them.<p>Another thing that made the quiz difficult is that, even though Kirby and Touhou are both video game series, many of these songs come from media other than games; but they are all official.<p>If you're a Touhou fan who played the quiz and are dying to know just where these absurd song titles come from, or if you're a Kirby fan who needs a refresher, I hope you enjoy reading this. I tried my best to keep the explanations spoiler-free, so if you're curious about the finer details, I encourage you to play the games listed here for yourself!<p>I recommend you <a href=https://www.sporcle.com/games/SYZekrom/Kirby-or-Touhou-music-track-names target=_blank>play the quiz</a> before reading this list. Also, I recommend you <a href=https://ublockorigin.com/ target=_blank>install an adblocker</a> before playing the quiz.<details><summary>Spoilers for the quiz!</summary><ul>

Though this translation may look odd, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsella_bursa-pastoris target=_blank>shepherd's purse is actually the name of a real plant</a>, it is a type of grass; and the Japanese title <em>does</em> specify <span lang=ja>ぺんぺん草</span> (shepherd's purse) instead of just <span title=くさ lang=ja>草</span> (grass). Plays during levels in Jambastion)
