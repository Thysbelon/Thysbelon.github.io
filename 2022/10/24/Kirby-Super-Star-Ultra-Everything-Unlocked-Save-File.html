<h1 itemprop=headline>Kirby Super Star Ultra Everything Unlocked Save File</h1>
<time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2022-10-24>24 October 2022</time>
<p>I had trouble finding a 100% save file for this game online, so I'm uploading mine!
<p><del datetime=2023-1-9>Actually, my save file is only at 92% completion, but it should have most of the content unlocked. You can also use the <a href=https://www.neoseeker.com/kirby-super-star-ultra/action_replay/ds/ target=_blank>Action Replay cheat code</a> <code>1205C170 0000ffff</code> to unlock all movies.</del> <br><ins datetime=2023-1-9 style=text-decoration:none>Update 1/9/2023: I used the wayback machine to recover <a href=https://gbatemp.net/download/2696-kirby-super-stars-ultra-usa.2998/ target=_blank>Hillsy_'s completed save file</a>. I used cheat codes to get the last few unlocks, and now I have a <a href=Kirby-Super-Star-Ultra-(USA).zip>100% completed save file for the US version of Kirby Super Star Ultra!</a></ins>
<p>Are you wondering why I was looking for a 100% save file? If you look in the Kirby tag, you'll find out what I was working on...
<p><ins datetime=2022-11-8 style=text-decoration:none>Update 11/8/2022: Speedrun.com has a 100% save file for the Japanese version: Kirby Ultra Super Deluxe, under the "Resources" tab. This website also has a guide on how to import the save file into Desmume due to the file being in the uncommon .duc format. <a href=Hoshi-no-Kirby-Ultra-Super-Deluxe-(Japan).zip>Here is the same save file converted into the universal .sav format</a>.</ins>
