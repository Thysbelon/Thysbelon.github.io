<time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2022-12-06> 6 December 2022</time>
<p>Kirby Star Allies uses high definition 3D models for characters and environments. User interface elements use flat vector art with lots of patterns and a limited palette of solid colors; gradients are only used in backgrounds.
<p>Sequence Director Tatsuya Kamiyama stated that the HD display is the reason they used a free-roam map rather than a linear one.<br><q cite=https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_Star_Allies_Channel><!--April 25th, 2018-->the Nintendo Switch™ system's higher resolution makes it easier to show a broader view...while keeping Kirby a size where you can see him clearly</q>.
<p>The environments have whimsical elements to distinguish them from our own planet. World 1 takes place in an idyllic forest/field, which contains diagonal plaid patterned dirt, square foliage, what looks like popsicle sticks stuck in the ground, and hills shaped like rings.
<p>The opening demo, user interface elements, and boss introduction splash screens use a halftone effect, flat colors, and bold lines to evoke a comic book feel.
