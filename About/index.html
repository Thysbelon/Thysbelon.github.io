<h1>About</h1>
<img src=me.svg alt="An illustration of me, a hummingbird moth, sitting in front of a computer and waving." class="restrictsize fri" style=--w:400px><!--further optimize this svg-->
<p>Hello! I'm Thysbelon; first name &ldquo;Dana&rdquo;. I'm a guy and my pronouns are he/him. I'm a college student currently studying Interactive Technologies. I love programming and technology, and I love to use them to make art. My main interests are:
<ul>
<li>web development
<li>digital art
<li>digital photography
<li>digital design
</ul>
<p>On my blog, I post about things that I find interesting or inspiring; video games I like; beautiful designs; and <a href=/Tags/Guide>guides on how to do very specific, obscure things that I couldn't find a guide on!</a>

<h2>My Main Strengths</h2>
<p>Rather than use a visual website builder like WordPress to make my website, I carefully coded everything by writing the <b class=color>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> myself. This means that my website runs faster, has better SEO, and is more accessible than websites made hastily using a visual editor.<!-- https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-www-wildheartflowers-com-portfolio/h3gw31kr7h?form_factor=mobile https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-hakim-se/aw8qmkfkr3?form_factor=mobile --> I also designed this website myself, and I have designed two other websites for my courses using <b class=color>Figma</b> (<a href=https://www.figma.com/proto/mJrrMrg1HNLFTj7eDAUJQM/Final-Project-Prototype?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=1-2&viewport=417%2C281%2C0.53&t=wFTAc60QA6kdR4jR-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design target=_blank>prototype</a>) and <b class=color>Wix</b> (<a href=https://pxr3ms8xd.wixsite.com/gracilis target=_blank>website</a>).
<p>I also use a <b class=color>static site generator</b> to automate some website building tasks on this blog; for example, I do not have to manually alter the home page everytime I write a new post thanks to the static site generator. The static site generator I am currently using is <b class=color>Jekyll</b>, but recently I have been studying <b class=color>Eleventy</b> and I am planning to use it instead.
<p>Aside from my blog, I also often use <b class=color>Emscripten</b> to take a program written in <b class=color>C</b>, compile it to <b class=color>WebAssembly</b>, and turn it into a webapp/library for other programmers to use.
<p>I draw and make music occasionally. I practice piano every week, and I like to cover other people's songs occasionally. I use Krita to draw. Music making apps I've used include Reaper, GarageBand, and LMMS; I also enjoy using music software specialized for chiptune (retro game music) like FamiStudio and Furnace Tracker. <a href=/2023/10/04/Drawcia-Sorceress-ZX-Spectrum-Beeper-Cover>My most recent drawing and cover are in this post</a>.
<p>last, I love taking photos, and I use a <b class=color>Panasonic Lumix MKII</b> camera.

<h2>What I'm Studying</h2>

<!--<p>I <a href=https://www.figma.com/proto/mJrrMrg1HNLFTj7eDAUJQM/Final-Project-Prototype?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=1-2&viewport=417%2C281%2C0.53&t=wFTAc60QA6kdR4jR-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design target=_blank>designed a website prototype in Figma</a> for my Web Design course; you can see the rest of my completed Web Design assignments on the <a href=/UI-UX>UI UX page</a>.
<p>I also created a <a href=https://pxr3ms8xd.wixsite.com/gracilis target=_blank>Wix website</a> for my digital marketing course; though it uses the same concept as the UI UX course website, it focuses more on blog posts than design.-->

<p>As I mentioned in the section above, I have created a <a href=https://www.figma.com/proto/mJrrMrg1HNLFTj7eDAUJQM/Final-Project-Prototype?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=1-2&viewport=417%2C281%2C0.53&t=wFTAc60QA6kdR4jR-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design target=_blank>website prototype in Figma</a> for my web design course, and a Wix website with three fully written blog posts for my digital marketing course. All of my web design assignments are archived on the <a href=/UI-UX><span class=nowrap>UI UX</span> page</a>.

<p>In my Digital Storytelling course, I learned about video creation (Script-writing, filming, and editing). You can <a href=https://youtu.be/q_L783-OPgw target=_blank>watch a video I made</a> to see what I'm capable of.

<p>In my course on Databases, I learned how to create and manage an organized database, how to create queries using <b class=color>SQL</b>, and how to use Microsoft Access. For my final in this course, I created a <a href=Rhythm_Heaven_User-Created_Content_Hypothetical_Database.zip>database that could be used for a hypothetical Rhythm Heaven video game with user-created content</a>.

<p>In my Digital Design course, I learned about brand development. I have created:
<ul>
<li>a logo
<li>two 3D models
<li>a design brief
<li>three social media ads
</ul>
<p>You can see my finished work in <a href=/Portfolio/#Digital-Design>my portfolio</a>, and my creative process on the <a href=/Digital-Design>Digital Design page</a>. Some of the skills I learned from that are:
<ul>
<li>Design Thinking
<li>how to use Illustrator
<li>how to use the video timeline in Photoshop
<li>how to create new design iterations based on feedback
</ul>
<p>During brand development, I think carefully about what the brand's values are, and how to communicate them visually. I pay close attention to any and all feedback and try my best to improve my designs.

<p>I also studied <a href=/Portfolio/#Digital-Photography>Digital Photography</a>. I can:
<ul>
<li>Use a camera with full manual controls
<li>Use Camera Raw and Photoshop to retouch photos
</ul>
<p>My favorite subjects to take photos of are plants, animals, and insects!<img src=/emoji/🐞.svg alt=🐞><img src=/emoji/🌹.svg alt=🌹><img src=/emoji/🐈.svg alt=🐈>

<p>There are subjects that I enjoy studying in my free time. <span class=nowrap>They are:</span>
<ul>
<li><a href=/ホーム>Japanese</a>
<li>the piano
<li><a href=/Portfolio/#Digital-Art>digital art</a>
<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<li>JavaScript
<li><a href=https://jekyllrb.com target=_blank>Jekyll</a>
<li>Emscripten
</ul>
<!--<p>I designed and coded this entire website myself! I use Jekyll to automatically update the homepage and navbar whenever I make a change. I type out pages using HTML, and try to make them as accessible as possible. I use CSS to customize the appearance of my website exactly the way I want it to be. I don't use much javascript on this website, because I want this website to be accessible to people who leave javascript off by default, either to stay safe or to shut out annoying distractions.-->
<p>I love learning new things about web development, and I'm always trying to improve my website!
<p>You can read about the apps I compiled with Emscripten on my <a href=/Programs>programs page</a>.

<p>I have studied the following a little in College:
<ul>
<li>Python
<li>the Unity game engine
<li>systems analysis and design
<li>Visual Basic
</ul>

<h2>Why the name &ldquo;Thysbelon?&rdquo;</h2>
<img src=pexels-chris-f-5298611-2.webp loading=lazy alt="Hummingbird moth collecting pollen from a violet flower.">
<p>I chose my name because of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemaris_thysbe target=_blank>Hummingbird Clearwing Moth</a>, whose scientific name is <i>Hemaris thysbe</i>. I first heard about this animal on the internet, and I always loved the way it looked. To me, it was one of those wonderful animals you hear about and you love, even though you'll probably never see one in person. That is, until the day I <em>did</em> see one in person, hovering around a flower bush. I was overjoyed! Apparently, they live close to me. From then on, it became my favorite local animal; and when I was trying to think of animals to use for a name, I knew it was the one.
<p>The "lon" part doesn't mean anything; I just wanted to make sure no-one confused my name for the real moth. <img src=/emoji/😅.svg alt=😅>
