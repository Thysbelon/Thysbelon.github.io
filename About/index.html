<p>Hello! I'm Thysbelon; first name &ldquo;Dana&rdquo;. I'm a guy and my pronouns are he/him. I'm a college student currently studying Interactive Technologies. I love programming and technology, and I love to use them to make art. My main interests are:
<ul>
<li>web development
<li>digital art
<li>digital photography
<li>digital design
</ul>
<p>On my blog, I post about things that I find interesting or inspiring; video games I like; beautiful designs; and <a href=/Tags/Guide>guides on how to do very specific, obscure things that I couldn't find a guide on!</a>
<h2>What I'm Studying</h2>

<p>Recently, I have studied the following in College:
<ul>
<li>Python
<li>the Unity game engine
<li>systems analysis and design
<li>Visual Basic
</ul>

<p>In my Digital Storytelling course, I learned about video creation (Script-writing, filming, and editing). You can <a href=https://youtu.be/q_L783-OPgw target=_blank>watch a video I made</a> to see what I'm capable of.

<p>In my course on Databases, I learned how to create and manage a database, how to create queries using <strong>SQL</strong>, and how to use Microsoft Access. For my final in this course, I created a <a href=Rhythm_Heaven_User-Created_Content_Hypothetical_Database.zip>database that could be used for a hypothetical Rhythm Heaven video game with user-created content</a>.

<p>In my Digital Design course, I learned about brand development. I have created:
<ul>
<li>a logo
<li>two 3D models
<li>a design brief
<li>three social media ads
</ul>
<p>You can see my finished work in <a href=/Portfolio/#Digital-Design>my portfolio</a>, and my creative process on the <a href=/Digital-Design>Digital Design page</a>. Some of the skills I learned from that are:
<ul>
<li>Design Thinking
<li>how to use Illustrator
<li>how to use the video timeline in Photoshop
<li>how to create new design iterations based on feedback
</ul>
<p>During brand development, I think carefully about what the brand's values are, and how to communicate them visually. I pay close attention to any and all feedback and try my best to improve my designs.

<p>I also studied <a href=/Portfolio/#Digital-Photography>Digital Photography</a>. I can:
<ul>
<li>Use a camera with full manual controls
<li>Use Camera Raw and Photoshop to retouch photos
</ul>
<p>My favorite subjects to take photos of are plants, animals, and insects!<img src=/emoji/üêû.svg alt=üêû><img src=/emoji/üåπ.svg alt=üåπ><img src=/emoji/üêà.svg alt=üêà>

<p>There are subjects that I enjoy studying in my free time. <span>They are:</span>
<ul>
<li><a href=/„Éõ„Éº„É†>Japanese</a>
<li>the piano
<li><a href=/Portfolio/#Digital-Art>digital art</a>
<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<li>JavaScript
<li><a href=https://jekyllrb.com target=_blank>Jekyll</a>
<li>Emscripten
</ul>
<p>I designed and coded this entire website myself! I use Jekyll to automatically update the homepage and navbar whenever I make a change. I type out pages using HTML, and try to make them as accessible as possible. I use CSS to customize the appearance of my website exactly the way I want it to be. I don't use much javascript on this website, because I want this website to be accessible to people who leave javascript off by default, either to stay safe or to shut out annoying distractions.<p>I love learning new things about web development, and I'm always trying to improve my website!
<p>You can read about the apps I compiled with Emscripten on my <a href=/Programs>programs page</a>.
<h2>Why the name &ldquo;Thysbelon?&rdquo;</h2>
<img src=pexels-chris-f-5298611-2.webp loading=lazy alt="Hummingbird moth collecting pollen from a violet flower.">
<p>I chose my name because of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemaris_thysbe target=_blank>Hummingbird Clearwing Moth</a>, whose scientific name is <i>Hemaris thysbe</i>. I first heard about this animal on the internet, and I always loved the way it looked. To me, it was one of those wonderful animals you hear about and you love, even though you'll probably never see one in person. That is, until the day I <em>did</em> see one in person, hovering around a flower bush. I was overjoyed! Apparently, they live close to me. From then on, it became my favorite local animal; and when I was trying to think of animals to use for a name, I knew it was the one.
<p>The "lon" part doesn't mean anything; I just wanted to make sure no-one confused my name for the real moth. <img src=/emoji/üòÖ.svg alt=üòÖ>
