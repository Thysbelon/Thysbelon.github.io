			<time datetime=2022-02-08 >08 February 2022</time>
			<p>Hello! There were a few times when I was writing my previous posts that I wanted to talk about video games, but I was worried that doing so would come across as unprofessional. Well, considering that the course I'm in <em>teaches game design</em>, I figured it's time to stop being so scared.</p>

<p>In <a href=placeholder>my first post</a>; I mentioned that a design can be solid on its own, but ineffective for the thing it's used for. I was thinking of <cite>Mario Party...

	<p>Hello! Today I'm going to talk a bit more about why I chose the designers that I did in my previous post.</p>
	<p>I mentioned that my favorite cover in the collection was <cite>Everything Matters!</cite>. The first thing I like about this cover is that it uses only four colors. Whenever I draw, I always try to limit the number of colors I use, and I really like character designs that use only three colors. Designs like these are simple and memorable.</p>

	<p>Hello, this is my first blog post!</p><p>As part of my first assignment in Digital Design, I was told to pick three designers from the <a target=_blank href=https://designarchives.aiga.org/#/collections>AIGA Design Archives</a> that inspire me. It was hard to choose when there was so much material, but I really liked the book covers, so I choose my designers from there.</p><p>The designers I chose were Isaac Tobin, John Fullbrook III, and Rodrigo Corral. My favorite design was the cover of <span class=nowrap><cite>Everything Matters!</cite></span> As you may be...
