<h2>Copalli Rum Ad Sketch</h2>
<p><time datetime="2023-09-17">17 September 2023</time>: My first assignment was to sketch three ideas for a Copalli Rum Instagram post. We were given a small set of 20 photos, 2 headlines, 1 tagline, and 1 call to action to work with. Due to my proficiency in image editing software, and due to the fact that we weren't allowed to look for image material on the internet, I found it easier to dive right into photo-editing instead of drawing a sketch first. <em>However</em>, the below images are still rough concepts; it is likely that my next assignment will be to refine them.
<p>I made these concepts in one day using <a href=https://krita.org/ target=_blank>Krita</a>.
