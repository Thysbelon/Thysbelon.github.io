<h1>UI UX</h1>
<p>This page is for posting my completed UI UX class assignments.

<h2>Copalli Rum Ad Sketch</h2>
<p><time datetime="2023-09-17">17 September 2023</time>: My first assignment was to sketch three ideas for a Copalli Rum Instagram post. We were given a small set of 20 photos, 2 headlines, 1 tagline, and 1 call to action to work with. Due to my proficiency in image editing software, and due to the fact that we weren't allowed to look for image material on the internet, I found it easier to dive right into photo-editing instead of drawing a sketch first. <em>However</em>, the below images are still rough concepts; it is likely that my next assignment will be to refine them.
<p>I made these concepts in one day using <a href=https://krita.org/ target=_blank>Krita</a>.

<h2>Copalli Rum Finished Social Media Ads</h2>
<p><time datetime="2023-09-25">25 September 2023</time>: I refined the Instagram ad from my previous assignment, and created two different version of it for Facebook and Twitter. Again, these were all made in one day with Krita.

</div>
<p>The Facebook version required the most work. The source image was in a portrait ratio, which made it unsuitable for landscape ads. To align the rum bottle on the rule of thirds, I had to extend the background. I did this by copying an otherwise invisible section of the image higher up, pasting it in the empty space, then using Krita's airbrush extensively to paint away the seam.
<p>I have heard that Photoshop is an industry standard. I hope Photoshop will make edits like this easier. Unfortunately, I have been unable to use Photoshop because Creative Cloud will not install on my machine. I restarted multiple times, uninstalled Creative Cloud multiple times, tried the repair option, none of the easy solutions worked. Because the uninstallation "completed with errors", I suspect I will have to manually remove leftover files and registry entries myself.

<h2>Social Media Ad Revisions</h2>
<p><time datetime="2023-10-04">4 October 2023</time>: Some revisions to the previous week's work after receiving feedback. I do think the previous versions were a bit more interesting artistically, but they were a bit busy and hard to read. These revisions below have better design. Made in a few hours with Krita.
