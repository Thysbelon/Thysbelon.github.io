<p>Hello! <img src=/emoji/ðŸ™‹.svg alt=ðŸ™‹><br>Recently, I discovered a very cool web port of Taiko no Tatsujin called <a href=https://taiko.bui.pm target=_blank>"Taiko Web"</a>. You can play both official charts and custom charts on it! It inspired me to make <a href=vista.zip>my own custom chart of "... Vista"</a>. I don't have much experience with making charts, so it's probably rough, but I enjoyed making it and I wanted to share it. Currently, there is an Oni difficulty and a Hard difficulty. I may tweak the chart at a later date to improve it, such as by making the Hard difficulty easier or adding a normal difficulty.<p>
