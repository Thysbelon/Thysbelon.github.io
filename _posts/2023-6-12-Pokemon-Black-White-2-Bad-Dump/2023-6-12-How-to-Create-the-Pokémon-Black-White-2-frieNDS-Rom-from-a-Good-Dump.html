title: "How to Create the Pokémon Black/White 2 frieNDS Rom from a Good Dump"
---
<p>It's funny how PokéCommunity and Project Pokémon each represent one extreme side to take on the same issue. On Project Pokémon, if a romhack contains even a <em>single</em> unaltered byte from the rom, it gets taken down. A lot of <a href=https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/46900-pokemon-super-mystery-dungeon-expanded target=_blank>Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon hacks are lost forever</a> because of this. Meanwhile, PokéCommunity is on the other extreme; they have no problem allowing a <a href=https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=497199 target=_blank>romhack that asks users to pirate a bad dump of the game</a>. Romhacks like these are impossible for people who legitimately dump roms from their own cartridges to use... unless you are using this guide :)
<p>Here's how to take your good dump of Pokémon Black 2 (CRC32 d4427fd1 when decrypted) or White 2 (777eb04f) and modify it to match the frieNDS bad scene dump (Black 2: 25ba3aa6, White 2: 95ab5437):
<ol>
<li>Open your rom in a hex editor.
<li>
	<ul>
	<li>Black 2: From address 0x11880000 to the end of the file, fill every byte with FF.
	<li>White 2: From address 0x11800000 to the end of the file, fill every byte with FF.
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
