<p>I had trouble finding a 100% save file for this game online, so I'm uploading mine!
<p>Actually, <a href="Kirby Super Star Ultra (USA).sav.zip">my save file</a> is only at 92% completion, but it should have most of the content unlocked. You can also use the <a href=https://www.neoseeker.com/kirby-super-star-ultra/action_replay/ds/ target=_blank>Action Replay cheat code</a> <code>1205C170 0000ffff</code> to unlock all movies.
<p>Are you wondering why I was looking for a 100% save file? If you look in the Kirby tag, you'll find out what I was working on...
<p>Update 11/8/2022: Speedrun.com has a 100% save file for the Japanese version: Kirby Ultra Super Deluxe, under the "Resources" tab. This website also has a guide on how to import the save file into Desmume due to the file being in the uncommon .duc format. <a href="Hoshi no Kirby Ultra Super Deluxe (Japan).sav.zip">Here is the same save file converted into the universal .sav format</a>.
