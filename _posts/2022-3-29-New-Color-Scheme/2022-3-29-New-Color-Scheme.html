<img src=thumb.png class=fri alt="Illustration of a hummingbird moth wearing a beret and holding a palette and paintbrush."><p>I spent a lot of time this week reading the <br><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility target=_blank>web accessibility tutorials at MDN</a> and trying to make my website more accessible. I changed the tags, categories, navbar, related posts, and archive to list elements, to make them better for screen readers. I also adjusted the color palette of my website to meet the WCAG AA accessibility guidelines. I'm happy I was able to come up with a color scheme that is both more accessible, and is prettier than the one I had before.</p>
