<p>I had hoped that installing WSL2 meant that I would never again have my plans thwarted by an app exclusive to an operating system I don't have; that I could compose music using the free DAW <a href=https://qtractor.org/ target=_blank>Qtractor</a> while not having to worry about a college course requiring Visual Studio or Access.
<p>Unfortunately, WSL2 is <em>not</em> the best of both worlds. Multiple limitations, such as the lack of systemd and the <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/237 target=_blank>lack of a sound system</a>, prevent apps like the Snap Store and Qtractor from working. Video players will still play sound, but anything requiring MIDI is sure to fail.
<p>One thing that caught me by suprise, however, is that last month <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/ target=_blank>Microsoft announced that they <em>would</em> be bringing systemd support to WSL!</a> I wonder if they'll keep adding more features like support for Advanced Linux Sound Architecture?
<p>Fun fact: <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/WSL#readme target=_blank>the official read-me for WSL</a> has a link to a list of programs known to work with and known not to work with WSL. Wish I knew about this earlier!
