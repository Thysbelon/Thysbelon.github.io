The second ad has large text that says: Quite possibly the only thing weirder than your sister."></a><p>I just finished my marketing course, which was required for my itech degree. I've always been wary of business, so I was worried that I wouldn't "get" marketing at all. I had no idea what to write in my paper... then I remembered something that gave me confidence; these advertisements.<p>Someone was paid to come up with these.<p>So, no matter how little I know about marketing, I still know more than these paid designers who worked for a prominent game company, so I think that's a pretty good accomplishment. <img src=/emoji/ðŸ˜Š.svg alt=ðŸ˜Š>
