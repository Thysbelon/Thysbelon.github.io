<p>I've never been that big of a fan of most emoji. Apple popularized the the use of gradients in emoji, but I think it just looks <em>so</em> ugly <img src=/emoji/üòï.svg alt=üòï>. Gradients look nice in a background, but the moment they're put into a character design they just look tacky. The reason I like flat colors so much is because they don't have any ugly gradients, they're easy to draw<img src=/emoji/‚úè.svg alt=‚úè>, and they're easy to read at small sizes <img src=/emoji/üôã.svg alt=üôã>.<p>Lots of emoji use only flat colors; but what makes the Lollipop<img src=/emoji/üç≠.svg alt=üç≠> set my favorite is how expressive they are <img src=/emoji/üòç.svg alt=üòç>. It's funny how this is both this set's greatest weakness and greatest strength <img src=/emoji/üòÖ.svg alt=üòÖ>. The way the emoji bend down<img src=/emoji/üò©.svg alt=üò©> or look up<img src=/emoji/üòò.svg alt=üòò> makes the expression harder to see at small sizes, and the big differences in expression compared to other emoji can lead to miscommunicationüò≥<img src=/emoji/üò≥.svg alt=üò≥>, and yet; these traits are what make this set stand out from apple, and all the people trying to copy apple <img src=/emoji/üçé.svg alt=üçé><img src=/emoji/üî´.svg alt=üî´><img src=/emoji/üòÜ.svg alt=üòÜ>.<p>And that's why I <em>had</em> to bring back these emoji <img src=/emoji/üòº.svg alt=üòº>. Google themselves has abandoned this set in favor of more apple-like emoji. However, I had an idea as to where I could still find them <img src=/emoji/üîç.svg alt=üîç>. Google is a big user of open source software. They make the original source documents for much of their work publicly available; so they can be easily modified or improved on by others <!--<a href=https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html target=_blank>-->(without pay)<!--</a>--><img src=/emoji/üòí.svg alt=üòí>. Github is currently the main platform for hosting source code, and they also keep a history of every change made to the source <img src=/emoji/üìÜ.svg alt=üìÜ>. I navigated to Google's repository for their Noto emoji, clicked on "releases", and scrolled down as far as I could and found a release made in September 2015, after the release of android 5 but before the release of android 6.0.1. Sure enough, when I downloaded the source code in this release; it contained original SVG files for all of the android 5.0 emoji <img src=/emoji/üòÑ.svg alt=üòÑ>.<p>Figuring how I could get those SVG files into a state where I could easily use them on my blog was difficult <img src=/emoji/üò•.svg alt=üò•>. My first idea was to use an emoji font, it just seemed the most intuitive <img src=/emoji/‚ò∫.svg alt=‚ò∫>. However, what was <em>not</em> intuitive was the <a href=https://pixelambacht.nl/2014/multicolor-fonts/#how-to-draw-multicolor-fonts-four-proposals target=_blank>four different standards for making colored fonts</a>, all of which have different levels of support across browsers and systems <img src=/emoji/üò´.svg alt=üò´>. I wanted to use the SVG-in-Opentype format, because this one had the least limitations and would be the easiest to make, since I already had SVG files ready to go <img src=/emoji/üëç.svg alt=üëç>. Sadly, there were very few user-friendly tools for making SVG-in-Opentype colored fonts <img src=/emoji/üòî.svg alt=üòî>. After a lot of struggling, I found <a href=https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/opentype-svg target=_blank>adobe's opentype-svg tools</a><img src=/emoji/üîß.svg alt=üîß>, which looked to be the most user-friedly tool available. The addsvg tool required a host font to add the SVGs to, for which I used <a href=https://github.com/adobe-fonts/noto-emoji-svg target=_blank>Noto Emoji SVG</a>. It worked perfectly, however, I only realized afterward that using a font format only supported by firefox was a terrible idea, and it would be much better to use inline SVGs instead, so I did that <img src=/emoji/üòÖ.svg alt=üòÖ>. I changed the names of the SVG documents to match the emoji they represented, so I could more easily type them in <img src=/emoji/üíª.svg alt=üíª>. Renaming them all was a bit difficult, so you can <a href="https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Thysbelon/Thysbelon.github.io/tree/main/emoji" target=_blank>download them at the emoji folder of my website (2.46 MB)</a><img src=/emoji/üêà.svg alt=üêà>. If you're interested in the font, you can <a href=Android-5-Emoji.zip>download the emoji font here</a><img src=/emoji/üëà.svg alt=üëà>.
