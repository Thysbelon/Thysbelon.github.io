<p><a href=https://www.romhacking.net/translations/2456/ target=_blank>There is only one english patch available for <span lang=ja title="Nanashi no Geemu: Me">ナナシ ノ ゲエム 目</span></a>, unfortunately that patch was made using a bad dump and is thus impossible to patch onto a legitimate good dump of <span lang=ja>ナナシ ノ ゲエム 目</span>. Fortunately, the only difference between the good dump and the bad dump is an underdumped header, so we can easily modify the good dump to be the same as the patchable bad dump.
<p>Simply open the good dump (which should have a CRC32 checksum of f6d7cf2a. if it has 35005705, decrypt it) in a hex editor, and replace all data in between addresses 0x320 and 0x1000 with zeroes.
<h2>Lessons on Things You'll See in Hex Editors</h2>
<p>An "address", also known as an "offset", is a location. For example, the 7th byte in a file would be located at address 7. In every hex editor I've seen, the addresses of every 16 bytes (0x10 in hexadecimal) are listed on the left.
<p>Writing "0x" before a number is used to indicate that the number is in hexadecimal. Decimal is the counting system we use everyday; counting to 10 goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Hexadecimal is a counting system used in computer programming; hexadecimal uses both the numbers used in the decimal system <em>and</em> latin letters from A to F to represent numbers; counting to 0x10 in hexadecimal goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10. "10" in hexadecimal is 16 in decimal, that's why it's important to write the number as 0x10 so people <em>know</em> it's a hexadecimal number.
<p>A byte is a two digit hexadecimal number; they range from 0 to 0xFF (255 in decimal).
