<p>WiiFlow is an app that displays Wii and GameCube <!--disc images-->games in a pretty coverflow view. The app used to have a wide variety of themes to customize its appearance to your liking; but as WiiFlow gained new features that required new UI elements, the themes were not updated.
<p><a href=Orchid-updated.zip>I put in a little bit of work to update the Orchid theme</a> to support the latest version of WiiFlow. It's still very incomplete; most of the settings menu will not display correctly, but the main menu and frequently used settings are functional. I also changed the "USB" icon to a "Wii" icon. I hope you enjoy using it. The Orchid theme was created by Benjay, Jiiwah, and Roku93 on GBATemp.
<p>From the WiiFlow wiki: <blockquote>Download the theme you want and then extract its contents into the /wiiflow/themes directory.  Next time you load WiiFlow go to the config menu and you should be able to change the Theme from DEFAULT to whichever theme you have added.</blockquote>
<p>I also have <a href=WiiFlow-Orchid-WiiUMenu-Banner.7z>images for a shortcut to Wiiflow on the Wii U menu</a>.
<p>On a Haxchi Wii U: install <a href=https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-wiiu2hbc-a-hbl2hbc-forwarder-channel.455991/ target=_blank>WiiU2HBC</a> and <a href=https://gbatemp.net/threads/hbl2hbc-v1-1-boot-from-wiiu-hbl-into-vwii-hbc.455673/ target=_blank>HBL2HBC</a>. You can replace WiiU2HBC's icon with my custom WiiFlow icons after installing. I recommend using <a href=https://github.com/Random06457/Wii-U-Title-Boot-Editor target=_blank>Wii U Title Boot Editor</a>. If Wii U Title Boot Editor does not work for you, use the files in the folder "tga-files" and transfer them to the shortcut's meta folder via ftp (be careful when doing this! View the Wii U's tga files to make sure you have the correct title).
<p>(The above steps apply <em>only</em> to Haxchi. I do not know how to make a Wii U Menu to WiiFlow shortcut that uses these custom images for Aroma)
