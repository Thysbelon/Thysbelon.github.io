<p>On November 6th 2021, Did You Know Gaming uploaded a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esIL1W_QBns target=_blank>video about the origins of Mew</a>. This video made me aware of an <a href=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train-225842.html target=_blank>Iwata Asks interview with GameFreak published after the release of HeartGold and SoulSilver</a>. They began by talking about how the Pok√©mon series became popular. Ishihara said that Mew <q>played an extremely significant role</q> in the first pair of games' rise to fame. Morimoto then stated:<blockquote>due to an unforeseen bug, Mew ended up appearing in some players‚Äô games. It looked like we planned all of this, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. So although it caused all sorts of problems to many concerned, fortunately enough it ended up having a positive effect.</blockquote><p>Apparently, this bug that caused Mew to appear in games was discovered <em>before</em> the first official distribution of Mew from CoroCoro Comic.
<p>This came as somewhat of a shock to me, because many English sources confidently state that the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125011704/http://gamefaqsarchive.com/index.php?pg=463" target=_blank>glitch to catch Mew was discovered in 2003</a>, after Ruby and Sapphire's release! To me, it seemed that there was a glitch that occured only in Red and Green that was completely undocumented on English Pok√©mon sources. Fortunately, Bulbapedia links to other Pok√©mon wikis in foreign languages, so I checked to see if there were unfamiliar Mew glitches. <a href=https://wiki.„Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥.com/wiki/Ë£èÊäÄ‰∏ÄË¶ß_(Á¨¨‰∏Ä‰∏ñ‰ª£)#„Éü„É•„Ç¶„ÅÆÊçïÁç≤ target=_blank><span lang=ja>„Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥</span>Wiki's list of gen 1 glitches listed a Mew glitch different from the long-range trainer method</a>; below is my attempt at translating the instructions.</section><section>
<h2 style=margin-top:-2rem>Catching Mew</h2>
<p>Items Needed:<ul>
<li>Master Ball
<li>Two key items (<span lang=ja>„Åü„ÅÑ„Åõ„Å§„Å™„Å©„ÅÜ„Åê</span>)
<li>14 items</ul>
<p>Instructions:<ol>
<li>Place the master ball, the key item, and the key item in that order (the order of items after that doesn't matter)
<li>Enter the long grass to the right of Celadon (<span lang=ja>„Çø„Éû„É†„Ç∑</span>)
<li>Navigate to the 14th item in the bag, press "select", then press B twice to exit.
<li>Enter a battle, open the Pok√©mon menu, and press A on the highlighted Pok√©mon. The game will glitch. Run from the battle.<!--this step and step above were only translated correctly after I learned about the Select Glitch-->
<li>Go to the second floor of Celadon Department store
<li>The moment you arrive at the second floor, go left three tiles and down one tile, then view your trainer card
<li>Talk to the clerk and select "<span lang=ja>„ÅÜ„Çä„Å´ „Åç„Åü</span>" (sell). Your item list should appear with these items in this order: master ball, key item, key item, glitch item.
<li>Scroll through the list until the 4th item, the glitch item, is on the top of the screen, then sell the glitch item. The music should stop.
<li>The game will automatically try to sell the key items, but they cannot be sold, so it returns to the clerk's dialogue options.
<li>Select "<span lang=ja>„Åπ„Å§„Å´ „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô</span>" (exits the dialogue with the clerk).
<li>The gym leader battle music should start playing, and Mew will be fished up.
<li>When you open the items menu, the master ball will automatically be thrown and Mew will be caught.</ol>
<!--<p>Notes:<ul>
<li>The order of the items must be set correctly when starting the glitch, because it is impossible to move them during the glitch.
<li>Other pok√©balls may be used to catch Mew, but the master ball is the most reliable. In addition, the master ball remains in the player's inventory after being used to catch Mew, so an infinite number of Mew can be caught by repeating the glitch.
<li>Mew caught using this glitch in the Gameboy version can be sent to Gold, Silver, and Crystal without issue, however, Mew caught using this glitch in the 3DS Virtual Console version cannot be transferred to Sun and Moon.--></ul></section><section><p>After going to the effort of translating all this, I realized I made a grave mistake: I forget to check the "exclusive to Japanese Red, Green, and Blue" section of Bulbapedia's list of gen 1 glitches! The reason I hadn't found it there earlier is because its title didn't contain the word "Mew", instead it was called the <span class=nowrap><a href=https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Select_glitches target=_blank>select glitch</a></span>, because the act of using the select button to swap Pok√©mon then pressing B has the potential to cause a lot of memory corruption! A lot of different effects can be achieved by using this glitch, just one of which is catching Mew. Though I was wrong in thinking that this glitch was undocumented, I hope you enjoyed learning about the method the first Pok√©mon players may have used to catch Mew! <img src=/emoji/üôã.svg alt="üôã"> Goodbye!
