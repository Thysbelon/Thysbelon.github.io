title: 'NoScript Blocks the &lt;object&gt; Tag when it Blocks Scripts'
---
<img src=noscript5.webp alt="A screenshot of NoScript's settings. Under the title 'Enable these capabilities', script is unchecked and object is checked.">
<p>NoScript has separate checkboxes for blocking "scripts" and "objects". I assumed that unchecking "scripts" would only block <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags on a page; and that leaving "object" checked would allow all <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tags to work as normal. When I was adjusting the CSS of my <a href={% post_url 2022-2-19-How-to-Play-Custom-Songs-in-Vib-Ribbon-on-an-Emulator %}>Vib-Ribbon post</a>, I noticed the animated background, which is an <code>@keyframes</code>-animated-SVG embedded via an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag, had disappeared. It would seem that blocking JavaScript using NoScript <em>also</em> blocks <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tags, even if the data of the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag does not contain any JavaScript. This is <em>not</em> the case with other methods of blocking JavaScript, such as using uBlock Origin or setting permissions in Chromium.
