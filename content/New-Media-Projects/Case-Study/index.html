<h2 class=uppercase>Description:</h2>
<p>For the New Media Projects course, a course about using product design to solve problems, I decided to try to tackle the challenge of converting paper-based forms and records to digital. This task turned out to be more difficult than I was expecting. I learned a lot about the challenges organizations face when attempting to transition to digital records. My final project is a slideshow that details <!-- everything I learned about the design thinking process. -->how I applied the design thinking process.

<h2 class=uppercase>Results:</h2>
<p>Over the course, I created Figma prototypes of <a href=https://www.figma.com/proto/dgaO0oHMPX8dI2SjtJZad8/PDF.js-simple-fork-proto?type=design&node-id=1-2&t=8BxU2Hn3cvBR4p6B-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design target=_blank>a simplified modification of the open source PDF reader PDF.js</a> and <a href=https://www.figma.com/proto/xZFQqvxFQ6Au0JEYYvAJEc/PDF-to-Digital-Form-Proto?type=design&node-id=2-34&t=27xQTmLBhmVhgYFA-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A34&mode=design target=_blank>a program that automatically converts a PDF to a digital form</a>.
<p>Here is my finished final project: a slideshow in which each slide shows one phase of the design thinking process, from "Empathize" to "Prototype".
