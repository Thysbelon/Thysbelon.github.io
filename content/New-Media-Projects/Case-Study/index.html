<h2 class=uppercase>Description:</h2>
<p>For the New Media Projects course, a course about using product design to solve problems, I decided to try to tackle the challenge of converting paper-based forms and records to digital. This task turned out to be more difficult than I was expecting. I learned a lot about the challenges organizations face when attempting to transition to digital records. My final project is a slideshow that details <!-- everything I learned about the design thinking process. -->how I applied the design thinking process.
<h2 class=uppercase>Challenges:</h2>
<p>When I started off, I had to complete my weekly assignments without much information from the client. To solve this, I initiated interviews with the client on my own. 
<p>Often, whenever I got to interview the client, I would learn that what I had been working on wouldn't work and that I needed to start over; but I handled this well because I knew from reading the IDEO field guide that discarding ideas that don't work is a natural and important part of the design thinking process.
<h2 class=uppercase>Strategy:</h2>
<p>Whenever I was unsure about what to do, I would seek help from my professor and my family. Collaborating and talking with others is a crucial part of the design thinking process, because combining the knowledge of many different people with different perspectives is the best way to arrive at the solution.
<h2 class=uppercase>Design Approach:</h2>
<p>Whenever I thought about how an idea would be implemented, I tried to think of what flaws the idea might have and how those flaws could be fixed or alleviated.
<p>I always checked to see if an idea I had already existed, and if the existing product met my expectations. There's no point putting a huge effort into prototyping an idea if an adequate implementation of it already exists.
<h2 class=uppercase>Results:</h2>
<p>Over the course, I created Figma prototypes of <a href=https://www.figma.com/proto/dgaO0oHMPX8dI2SjtJZad8/PDF.js-simple-fork-proto?type=design&node-id=1-2&t=8BxU2Hn3cvBR4p6B-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design target=_blank>a simplified modification of the open source PDF reader PDF.js</a> and <a href=https://www.figma.com/proto/xZFQqvxFQ6Au0JEYYvAJEc/PDF-to-Digital-Form-Proto?type=design&node-id=2-34&t=27xQTmLBhmVhgYFA-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A34&mode=design target=_blank>a program that automatically converts a PDF to a digital form</a>.
<p>Here is my finished final project: a slideshow in which each slide shows one phase of the design thinking process, from "Empathize" to "Prototype".
