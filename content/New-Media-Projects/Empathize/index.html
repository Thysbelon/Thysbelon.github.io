<h1>Empathize</h1>
<p>The following are recommendations for the client <a href=https://touchny.org target=_blank>TOUCH</a>. These recommendations are supported by evidence gathered from data, observations, and interviews.
<p>An important part of human-centered design thinking is coming up with as many ideas as possible; from this massive pool, we can narrow down which ideas are technically feasible and financially viable.

<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th scope="row">I can improve the website. I am skilled at web development. I will make fixes that TOUCH staff request, and I can suggest and make my own fixes if desired and feasible.</th>
		<td>I perused TOUCH's website and noticed many things that could use improvement: pages that could use more information, out-of-date email addresses, and accessibility mistakes.</td>
		<td>2 days to 1 week</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th scope="row">Move records from physical paper to electronic files, and provide extensive training</th>
		<td>My interview with the Interfaith Emergency Food Pantry of Pleasantville revealed that, at this time, they use a physical spreadsheet to sign in their clients. Interfaith stated that they plan on moving to a digital sign-in system provided by Feeding Westchester, but they had some issues with the system due to the fact that training started late.</td>
		<td>4 weeks</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th scope="row">Run a campaign to get ShopRite and other supermarkets to donate to food pantries</th>
		<td><a href=https://www.shopritepartnersincaring.org/ target=_blank>While ShopRite donates money to charity, they don't seem to donate food</a>. There are many supermarkets out there that just trash their food. If all those supermarkets, or even just ShopRite, donated their food instead it could have a big impact on food distribution.</td>
		<td>10 weeks</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th scope="row">Run a campaign to encourage young people to volunteer. Make it easy to get on board. Help volunteers feel prepared. Maybe say it's an opportunity for social interaction</th>
		<td>In my interview with Interfaith Food Pantry, they also mentioned that they're often short-staffed. I've also read that retired seniors are usually the only ones who volunteer at food pantries. Young people should also have the time to volunteer; we need to figure out how to make them excited to volunteer.</td>
		<td>5 weeks</td>
