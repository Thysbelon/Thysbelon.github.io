<p>The Google Office Suite is useful for many use cases. You can quickly and easily make presentations with Google Slides. You can write papers with Google Docs.
<p>There doesn't seem to be a landing page for learning about the suite, so I'll link to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs_Editors target=_blank>Wikipedia's article on Google Docs Editors</a>. It should have a landing page; a good landing page can quickly give someone an overview of a product.
