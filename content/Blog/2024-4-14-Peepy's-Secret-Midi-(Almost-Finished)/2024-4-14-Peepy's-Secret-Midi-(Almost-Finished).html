<p>Emamouse's songs for ItemLabel use a lot of complex harmonies that remind me of the classical piano music I've been playing lately. The song "Peepy's Secret" has a lot of buzzing sound effects that make the song trippy and surreal, but it also makes the notes a little hard to hear; so to understand the song better, I decided to transcribe a midi version of it. I didn't finish transcribing the end of the song because I was getting a bit tired, but I hope you still find my midi useful. Feel free to download this <a href="peepy's-secret-almost-finished.mid">Peepy's Secret midi</a> and adapt it into sheet music or reference it for covers (credit to me would be appreciated).
<p>This transcription would not have been possible without <a href=https://vocalremover.org/splitter-ai target=_blank>this stem splitter AI</a> and <a href=https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/emamouse/peepys-secret target=_blank>this transcription of the chords and melody of the verse and chorus by mathyfurret</a>. If you plan on finishing this midi, please <a href=https://www.mediafire.com/file/hvy6r0pb95xl8ot/20210926_Peepy%2527s_Secret%255Brebalanced%255D.7z/file target=_blank>download the stems I split with the AI</a>.
<p>As I was writing this post, I just realized that the entire time I was transcribing the song, I accidently had all the stems set to a bass-boosted EQ. <img src=/emoji/ðŸ˜….svg alt=ðŸ˜…>
