title: "How to Create the Pokémon HeartGold/SoulSilver Xenophobia Rom from a Good Dump"
---
<del><p>Once again, I have discovered an old (2012) romhack of Drayano's that requires a bad dump in order to patch it.
<p>Once again, I will provide instructions on how to patch Sacred Gold and Storm Silver using a legitimate good dump of the game.</p></del>
<p>16 October 2023 edit: And once again, <strong>I am wrong!</strong> I wrote this post quickly and misremembered some things. <a href="/Blog/2023-6-17/What-to-do-if-a-Romhack-Patch-from-Project-Pokémon-Doesn't-Work">I've actually only encountered <em>one</em> other hack of Drayano's that uses a bad dump as a base rom (which has since been fixed)</a>. I'm writing this addition because, I don't know why I didn't think to try this earlier, but <a href=https://twitter.com/Drayano60 target=_blank>Drayano's twitter</a> bio has a <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-zmEVN0Mas6Q3lLbDJDaWNyaVU?resourcekey=0-o98YGOlDJ0JVXXjxoHprIA&usp=sharing target=_blank>Google Drive link to all of his old romhacks <em>with fixed patches!</em></a>
<p>Of course, these instructions will help with any romhack that requires these bad dumps: decrypted CRC32 of FFD28F00 for HeartGold and EBB387E7 for SoulSilver.

<h2>Method 1: Hex Editing Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a decrypted good dump of either HeartGold or SoulSilver in a hex editor
<li>Replace the bytes in addresses 0x00000330 through 0x00001000 with zeroes.
</ol>

<h2>Method 2: Patches</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href='4780 - Pokemon HeartGold (U)(Xenophobia).xdelta'>4780 - Pokemon HeartGold (U)(Xenophobia).xdelta</a>
<li><a href='4781 - Pokemon SoulSilver (U)(Xenophobia).xdelta'>4781 - Pokemon SoulSilver (U)(Xenophobia).xdelta</a>
</ul>

<p>After you have modified the good dump using either method 1 or method 2, you can apply the Sacred Gold or Storm Silver patch, or whatever romhack patch requires these bad dump base roms.
