<p>Microsoft Forms responses can be downloaded as an Excel Spreadsheet; but the fields will often have unnecessary line breaks, which causes these fields' names to be discarded when importing the spreadsheet into an MS Access database.
<p>Remove line breaks:
<ol>
	<li>Open the Find &amp; Replace box
	<li>Click on the Find field and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> on your keyboard
	<li>Leave the Replace field blank
	<li>Click "Replace All"
	<li>Save your workbook
	<li>Close and reopen Excel. This is necessary because Excel will automatically fill the Find field with whatever was last used, and it is impossible to delete line break characters from the Find field, so Find will be broken until Excel is restarted.
</ol>
