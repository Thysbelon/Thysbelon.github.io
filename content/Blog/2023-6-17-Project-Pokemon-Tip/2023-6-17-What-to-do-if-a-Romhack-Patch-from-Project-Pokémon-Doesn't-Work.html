<p>I mistakenly thought that the most recent version of Blaze Black and Volt White and its sequels <em>needed</em> to be patched onto a bad dump in order to function. The reason I mistakenly thought this is because the <a href=https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/2465-pok%C3%A9mon-blaze-black-2-pok%C3%A9mon-volt-white-2/ target=_blank>main download page</a> for these hacks has the bad versions of the patches. The good, most recent versions of these hacks can be found on the <a href=https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/24126-pok%C3%A9mon-blaze-black-2-pok%C3%A9mon-volt-white-2/?do=findComment&comment=283788 target=_blank>forum threads</a> for them, which are linked to in the main download page.
<p>So let me pass this lesson to you: <strong>if a romhack patch you downloaded from Project Pokémon isn't working, try looking in the thread for a fixed patch!</strong>
