<p>You may have heard of active styluses, which have lots of features and are battery operated; but did you know that styluses for capacitive touchscreens can be simple and inexpensive? Passive styluses do nothing except conduct the electricity from your finger to the tip of the stylus, so they work with almost any touchscreen and don't need to be charged.
<p>I learned this thanks to <a href=https://kommandotech.com/guides/what-is-a-stylus-pen/ target=_blank>Kommando Tech's article "What Is a Stylus Pen and How It Works"</a>. Please read their article if you want more information.
