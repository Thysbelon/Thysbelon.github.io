<p>I've heard that some companies host their videos on Vimeo rather than YouTube because they feel that YouTube's interface isn't a good fit with their branding. Unfortunately, Vimeo has a tendency to disconnect and be unstable.
<p><a href=https://sendvid.com target=_blank>Sendvid</a> is a simple, free video host that I've heard of. I haven't used it yet, but I have used their other service <a href=https://imgbox.com target=_blank>Imgbox</a> (an image hosting website) which I've found reliable and useful.
