<p>With Google getting worse and worse lately, it's helpful to use at least two different search engines. I use both <a href=https://duckduckgo.com target=_blank>DuckDuckGo</a> (which shares results with Bing) and occansionally Google when the former fails.
<p>There's also this <a href=https://s-n-arly.tumblr.com/post/690225102062764032/skip-google-for-research target=_blank>list of academic alternatives to Google compiled by Edward Clark</a>. I haven't used any of these, but you may find them interesting. <br>
When I do academic research I usually use <a href=https://www.jstor.org target=_blank>JSTOR</a>, but most of their articles are locked behind the need for a school account or payment.
<p>I've also heard of <a href=https://search.marginalia.nu/ target=_blank>search.marginalia.nu</a>. According to its creator, it's not designed to answer questions, but to show you websites you didn't know existed.
