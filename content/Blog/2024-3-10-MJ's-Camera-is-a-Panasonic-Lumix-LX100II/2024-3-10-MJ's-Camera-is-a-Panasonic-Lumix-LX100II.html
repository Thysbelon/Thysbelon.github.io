<p>I was watching <a href=https://youtu.be/M5bbFWluURk?t=8844 target=_blank>Snapcube's stream of Insomniac's Spider-Man</a>, and I noticed that MJ's camera looked very familiar. In fact, it's almost exactly the same as my camera: the Panasonic Lumix LX100 II!</p>

<p>This reveals another little detail: MJ takes photos with the flash on in this mission, but her camera doesn't have the flash module attached! Hmm, her camera must have been modified to add an in-body flash.
