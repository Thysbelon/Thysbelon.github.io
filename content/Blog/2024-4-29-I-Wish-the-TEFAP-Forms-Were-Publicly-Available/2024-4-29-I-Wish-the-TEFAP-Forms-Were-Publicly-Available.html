<p>My college work this semester involved trying to convert the PDF TEFAP forms to digital forms. When I initially did research, I found a few food pantry websites that had uploaded the PDF file of the form. However, I later found out that these forms were outdated!
<p>If there was a U.S. government webpage that had links to every version of the TEFAP Eligibility Attestation form, it would have made my work a lot easier. <br>
I can't think of any good reason why the forms should be hidden. There is no sensitive information on them, they're just blank forms. <br>
If the forms were publicly available, maybe the open-source community would make digital versions of the forms for food pantries to use.
