<p><a href=https://www.figma.com target=_blank>Figma</a> is great for designing user interfaces. This is mainly because of its excellent auto-alignment features, which aren't instrusive and are great at guessing what I want. For example, if you copy and immediately paste an object, the copy will be in the same place as the original; if you copy an object in one frame, then click another frame of the same size and paste, the position of the copy will be equivalent to the position of the original on its frame; etc. 
<p>I love web apps because they can run on any computer and any browser. Figma is a webapp.
