title: "How to Create the Pokémon Black/White SweeTnDs Rom from a Good Dump"
short: true
---
<p>I wrote this guide due to a <a href="/Blog/2023-6-17/What-to-do-if-a-Romhack-Patch-from-Project-Pok%C3%A9mon-Doesn't-Work">wrong assumption I made about a romhack</a>. I will still publish this guide anyway in case there is a Pokémon romhack out there that <em>doesn't</em> have a fixed version.
<p>There were too many differences between the SweeTnDs bad scene dump and the good dump of the game to make a hex editing guide, so I'm releasing a patch instead:
<ul>
<li><a href=SweeTnDs-Black.xdelta>Black SweeTnDs patch</a>
<li><a href=SweeTnDs-White.xdelta>White SweeTnDs patch</a>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href=https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/ target=_blank>xdelta</a> or <a href=https://www.romhacking.net/patch/ target=_blank>Rom Patcher JS</a> to apply the patch to a decrypted good dump of Black (CRC32 4f6e5580) or White (b552501c).
<li>After that, follow the patching instructions for the romhack you want to play.
</ol>
