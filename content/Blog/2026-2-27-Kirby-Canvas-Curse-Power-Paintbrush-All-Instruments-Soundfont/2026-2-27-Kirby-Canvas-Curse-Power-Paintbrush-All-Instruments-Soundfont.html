<p><a href=BANK_NIJI_all_4.sf2 download>Download the Kirby: Canvas Curse / Power Paintbrush All Instruments Soundfont</a>
<p>I used VGMTrans 1.3 (the latest version as of writing this) to convert all of the sound banks in Kirby: Canvas Curse to Soundfont, then I used the Soundfont editor Polyphone to copy and paste every instrument from every soundfont into one soundfont.
<p>This soundfont should work with every song in the game (except the AGBK songs, which are copied from previous Kirby games). This soundfont should also make it easier to make arrangements in the style of Kirby: Canvas Curse.
<p>Because I just used copy and paste to combine the instruments, there shouldn't be any reduction in quality.
