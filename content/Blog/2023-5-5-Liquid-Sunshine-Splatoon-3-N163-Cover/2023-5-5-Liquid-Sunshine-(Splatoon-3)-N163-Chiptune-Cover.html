<p>This cover would not have been possible without <a href=https://vocalremover.org/splitter-ai target=_blank>this music splitter AI</a>.
<p>I started messing around with using wavetable synth to replicate human vowel sounds in 3/25/2023. I liked the result so much, I wanted to make a cover using it. The <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZx61kSObTI target=_blank>music video for Liquid Sunshine</a> released not too long after, and it had on-screen lyrics! (though, Nintendo of America's romanized lyrics have <a href=https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Liquid_Sunshine#cite_note-1 target=_blank>many glaring inaccuracies</a>) I started making my cover on April 5th, and finished on April 22nd.
<p>I also experimented with stereo audio. Square 1 is panned hard left, square 2 hard right, wave 1 a little left, and wave 2 a little right.
