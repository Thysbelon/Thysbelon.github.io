<p>Many guides on how to create <a href=https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/Rip target=_blank>SiIvagunner-style "high quality rips"</a> for Famicom/NES games state to use <a href=http://famitracker.com/ target=_blank>FamiTracker</a>. A "tracker" is an unconventional music editor in which notes are typed into rows of text.
<br>Did you know that a more conventional side-scrolling music editor for Famicom music exists? It is <a href=https://famistudio.org target=_blank>FamiStudio</a>.
<p>In FamiStudio, you can import <a href=https://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=NSF target=_blank>NSF or NSFe files</a> containing chiptune music, and then freely edit the chiptune music.
<p><a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dka7s2sbwuJuTcs3BxupaXlTWERYuCwPNQi2_HwpGfs/ target=_blank>overcast07's guide "Obtaining sources for creating a high quality rip"</a>, which is one of many helpful documents that the <a href=https://siivagunner.fandom.com/wiki/Ripping target=_blank>"Ripping" page of the SiIvagunner Wiki</a> links to, also mentions that FamiStudio can be used to create rips. 
<br>He states that rips created in FamiStudio should be exported as NSF then rendered to an audio file using Game Emu Player and foobar2000, because FamiStudio's audio export has "substandard accuracy".
<br>overcast07 stopped updating this document in February 2024, so FamiStudio's audio export may have improved since then; 
<br>but if you wish to try this method, I believe the "download WAV" button on my <a href=/Web-Chiptune-Player/demo.html>Web-Chiptune-Player demo page</a> should render NSF files with the same accuracy as foobar2000 and Game Emu Player because they are both built off of the <a href=https://github.com/libgme/game-music-emu target=_blank>Game_Music_Emu</a> library; please export an NSFe file from FamiStudio so Web-Chiptune-Player knows how many seconds of audio to render!
