<p>With Persona 3 Reload having released recently, and "The Answer" being announced as DLC for it last March, the song <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--FtBd-RiKA target=_blank>"Heartful Cry"</a> was on my mind and I decided to listen to it again.
<br>As I was listening, I thought "in a 2A03 chiptune cover of this song, that <a href=https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2023-11-16/Pac-Man-Championship-and-Blaster-Master-Area-4-Game-Over-Ribbit-Triangle-Effect>triangle linear counter effect</a> would make for a great instrument to represent the harsh bass lead in the original".
<br>So, I made that 2A03 chiptune cover!
<p>I used Furnace tracker, because FamiStudio doesn't support the triangle counter effect. I started making the cover on the weekend, March 16th. I worked on it for hours each day to get it done before my next class, and finished on March 18th.
<p>I also uploaded a video to my YouTube channel of an <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYmPZVayAQ target=_blank>oscilloscope view of the cover</a>!
<h2>Introducing Web-Chiptune-Player</h2>
<p>Remember when I made a <a href=https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2023-3-13/Murders-(Hawaii-Part-II)-VRC6-Chiptune-Cover>chiptune cover of Murders</a>, but didn't post it on my blog until I finished coding an NSF player? I've done the same thing again! Currently, the only chiptune format that Furnace can export Famicom chiptunes to is VGM; so I couldn't use Web-NSF-Player or Web-GME-Player for this post. I had been experimenting with making more web players for more chiptune formats for a while, but making this VGM format cover motivated me to finally release a usable multi-format, multi-library web chiptune player. There are more features I would like to add, but I think Web-Chiptune-Player is in a good state right now.
<p>The purpose of Web-Chiptune-Player is to allow web developers to embed chiptune in their websites, as I have done in this very post; if that sounds interesting to you, then I hope you'll find <a href=https://github.com/Thysbelon/Web-Chiptune-Player target=_blank>Web-Chiptune-Player</a> useful! <img src=/emoji/ðŸ˜Š.svg alt=ðŸ˜Š>
