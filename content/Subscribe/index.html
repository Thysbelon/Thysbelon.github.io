<h2>Subscribe to Atom feed</h2>
<p>Atom is a language similar to RSS. It is used on many webpages. By using a Reader, you can receive a syndication of recent updates from every website you follow. I personally use <a href=https://nodetics.com/feedbro/ target=_blank>Feedbro</a> as my Atom and RSS reader; Feedbro is a browser extension. If Feedbro does not appeal, you may want to read <a href=https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/ rel="nofollow" target=_blank>Zapier's Top 5 Feed Aggregators</a>.</p>
