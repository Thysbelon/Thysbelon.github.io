<p>With Persona 3 Reload having released recently, and "The Answer" being announced as DLC for it last March, the song <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--FtBd-RiKA target=_blank>"Heartful Cry"</a> was on my mind and I decided to listen to it again.
<br>As I was listening, I thought "in a 2A03 chiptune cover of this song, that <a href=https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2023-11-16/Pac-Man-Championship-and-Blaster-Master-Area-4-Game-Over-Ribbit-Triangle-Effect>triangle linear counter effect</a> would make for a great instrument to represent the harsh bass lead in the original".
<br>So, I made that 2A03 chiptune cover!
<p>I used Furnace tracker, because FamiStudio doesn't support the triangle counter effect. I started making the cover on the weekend, March 16th. I worked on it for hours each day to get it done before my next class, and finished on March 18th.
<p>I also uploaded a video to my YouTube channel of an <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYmPZVayAQ target=_blank>oscilloscope view of the cover</a>!
<h2>Introducing Web-Chiptune-Player</h2>
<p>Remember when I made a <a href=https://thysbelon.github.io/Blog/2023-3-13/Murders-(Hawaii-Part-II)-VRC6-Chiptune-Cover>chiptune cover of Murders</a>, but didn't post it on my blog until I finished coding an NSF player? I've done the same thing again! Currently, the only chiptune format that Furnace can export Famicom chiptunes to is VGM; so I couldn't use Web-NSF-Player or Web-GME-Player for this post. I had been experimenting with making more web players for more chiptune formats for a while, but making this VGM format cover motivated me to finally release a usable multi-format, multi-library web chiptune player. There are more features I would like to add, but I think Web-Chiptune-Player is in a good state right now.
<p>The purpose of Web-Chiptune-Player is to allow web developers to embed chiptune in their websites, as I have done in this very post; if that sounds interesting to you, then I hope you'll find <a href=https://github.com/Thysbelon/Web-Chiptune-Player target=_blank>Web-Chiptune-Player</a> useful! <a href=/Blog/2024-4-6/Heartful-Cry-(Persona-3)-2A03-Cover-(and-Web-Chiptune-Player) tabindex=-1><img src=/emoji/ðŸ˜Š.svg alt=ðŸ˜Š></a>

<p>I was watching <a href=https://youtu.be/M5bbFWluURk?t=8844 target=_blank>Snapcube's stream of Insomniac's Spider-Man</a>, and I noticed that MJ's camera looked very familiar. In fact, it's almost exactly the same as my camera: the Panasonic Lumix LX100 II!</p>
<img src=/Blog/2024-3-10/LX100IIflash.webp alt="Photo of the LX100II with the flash module attached.">
<p>This reveals another little detail: MJ takes photos with the flash on in this mission, but her camera doesn't have the flash module attached! Hmm, her camera must have been modified to add an in-body flash.

			<time datetime=2024-02-23 >23 February 2024</time>
			<p>I spent about two weeks migrating my website from Jekyll to Eleventy. Jekyll is probably very good for simple websites, but I added a lot of complicated features to my website, so the Liquid code was a mess. Now that all that complicated code is in JavaScript, I feel like it'll be much easier to maintain.
<p>I'm not sure I can write a good post about my experiences, so I'll just make a big list of tips and links. (make sure...

			<p><a href=https://squarewave.neocities.org/ target=_blank>SquareWave</a> has a <a href=https://youtu.be/0OVX7diOP9I target=_blank>2A03 song that showcases a cool effect</a> that can be achieved by playing two square waves with the same notes at the same time, with the first's waveform set to 25% duty, and the second's set to <em>-25%</em><!--test_screenreader--> duty. This effect is called the "pseudofilter" (at least, that's what the comments call it) because of how its tinny, needly waveform resembles the sound of a 50% square wave run through a high pass filter. The basic steps...

			<h1><a href=/Blog/2023-11-16/Pac-Man-Championship-and-Blaster-Master-Area-4-Game-Over-Ribbit-Triangle-Effect>Pac-Man Championship Ed. and Blaster Master Area 4 & Game Over Ribbit Triangle Effect</a></h1>
			<time datetime=2023-11-16 >16 November 2023</time>
			<p><!--to do: put links to my yt uploads of these songs when I upload them--><a href=https://youtu.be/kiVtR-XF7h4?t=64 target=_blank>Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version's Normal Mode music</a> and Blaster Master's Area 4 and Game Over themes all use this interesting effect in the Famicom/NES's 2A03's triangle channel. <br>In Blaster Master, it sounds like a ribbit; calling to mind the main goal of this game: to rescue the protagonist's pet frog Fred. <br>In Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version, it sounds like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house target=_blank>overdriven synthesizers that one typically hears in acid music</a>. 
<p>These are both created using the same feature: the triangle's linear counter. By setting the linear counter to a low value between 1 and 3, it causes the triangle to pulse (mute and unmute itself) very quickly instead of sustaining a single note. Though it is not possible at the moment to create this effect in FamiStudio, it <em>is</em> possible in <a href=https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace>Furnace Tracker</a> using effect <code>19xx</code>. Here is a <a href=famicom-overdrive-triangle.fur>sample Furnace project file that shows this triangle effect</a>.
