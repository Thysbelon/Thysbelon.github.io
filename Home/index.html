<article><h1><a href=/2023/11/16/Pac-Man-Championship-and-Blaster-Master-Area-4-Game-Over-Ribbit-Triangle-Effect>Pac-Man Championship Ed. and Blaster Master Area 4 & Game Over Ribbit Triangle Effect</a></h1><time>16 November 2023</time><p><!--to do: put links to my yt uploads of these songs when I upload them-->Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version's Normal Mode music and Blaster Master's Area 4 and Game Over themes all use this interesting effect in the Famicom/NES's 2A03's triangle channel. <br>In Blaster Master, it sounds like a ribbit; calling to mind the main goal of this game: to rescue the protagonist's pet frog Fred. <br>In Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version, it sounds like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house target=_blank>overdriven synthesizers that one typically hears in acid music</a>. 
<p>These are both created using the same feature: the triangle's linear counter. By setting the linear counter to a low value between 1 and 3, it causes the triangle to pulse (mute and unmute itself) very quickly instead of sustaining a single note. Though it is not possible at the moment to create this effect in FamiStudio, it <em>is</em> possible in <a href=https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace>Furnace Tracker</a> using effect <code>19xx</code>. Here is a <a href=/2023/11/16/Pac-Man-Championship-and-Blaster-Master-Area-4-Game-Over-Ribbit-Triangle-Effect/../famicom-overdrive-triangle.fur>sample Furnace project file that shows this triangle effect</a>.</article><article><h1><a href=/2023/10/15/How-to-Create-the-Pok%C3%A9mon-HeartGold-SoulSilver-Xenophobia-Rom-from-a-Good-Dump>How to Create the Pokémon HeartGold/SoulSilver Xenophobia Rom from a Good Dump</a></h1><time>15 October 2023</time><del><p>Once again, I have discovered an old (2012) romhack of Drayano's that requires a bad dump in order to patch it. <p>Once again, I will provide instructions on how to patch Sacred Gold and Storm Silver using a legitimate good dump of the game.</p></del> <p>16 October 2023 edit: And once again, <strong>I am wrong!</strong> I wrote this post quickly and misremembered some things. <a href=https://thysbelon.github.io/2023/06/17/What-to-do-if-a-Romhack-Patch-from-Project-Pok%C3%A9mon-Doesn't-Work>I've actually only encountered <em>one</em> other hack of Drayano's that uses a bad dump as a base rom (which has since been fixed)</a>.

It really drives the song's tense nature. Unfortunately, the arranged version of Countdown from the 2023 remaster completely removes this lead instrument. <p>To my surprise, all the music files in the remaster are completely unencrypted, uncompressed WAVE files (The devs should've compressed them, they could have reduced the file size of the music from ~675 MB to ~63 MB). This made it very easy to modify the "Countdown" arrangement to include that lead instrument. <!--IfThisCommentIsNotPresent, <strong>WillBeOpenAndAllPageTextWillBe<strong>.FixThis-->...</article><article><h1><a href=/2023/06/17/What-to-do-if-a-Romhack-Patch-from-Project-Pok%C3%A9mon-Doesn't-Work>What to do if a Romhack Patch from Project Pokémon Doesn't Work</a></h1><time>17 June 2023</time><p>I mistakenly thought that the most recent version of Blaze Black and Volt White and its sequels <em>needed</em> to be patched onto a bad dump in order to function. The reason I mistakenly thought this is because the <a href=https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/file/2465-pok%C3%A9mon-blaze-black-2-pok%C3%A9mon-volt-white-2/ target=_blank>main download page</a> for these hacks has the bad versions of the patches. The good, most recent versions of these hacks can be found on the <a href=https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/24126-pok%C3%A9mon-blaze-black-2-pok%C3%A9mon-volt-white-2/?do=findComment&comment=283788 target=_blank>forum threads</a> for them, which are linked to in the main download page.
<p>So let me pass this lesson to you: <strong>if a romhack patch you downloaded from Project Pokémon isn't working, try looking in the thread for a fixed patch!</strong></article><div class=pnav><a class="btnlink fri" href=/Home/page/2/>Older Posts</a></div>
