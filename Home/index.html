This effect is called the "pseudofilter" (at least, that's what the comments call it) because of how its tinny, needly waveform resembles the sound of a 50% square wave run through a high pass filter. The basic steps of how to create it are...</article><article><h1><a href=/2023/11/16/Pac-Man-Championship-and-Blaster-Master-Area-4-Game-Over-Ribbit-Triangle-Effect>Pac-Man Championship Ed. and Blaster Master Area 4 & Game Over Ribbit Triangle Effect</a></h1><time>16 November 2023</time><p><!--to do: put links to my yt uploads of these songs when I upload them-->Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version's Normal Mode music and Blaster Master's Area 4 and Game Over themes all use this interesting effect in the Famicom/NES's 2A03's triangle channel. <br>In Blaster Master, it sounds like a ribbit; calling to mind the main goal of this game: to rescue the protagonist's pet frog Fred. <br>In Pac-Man Championship Edition Famicom Version, it sounds like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house target=_blank>overdriven synthesizers that one typically hears in acid music</a>. 
<p>These are both created using the same feature: the triangle's linear counter. By setting the linear counter to a low value between 1 and 3, it causes the triangle to pulse (mute and unmute itself) very quickly instead of sustaining a single note. Though it is not possible at the moment to create this effect in FamiStudio, it <em>is</em> possible in <a href=https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace>Furnace Tracker</a> using effect <code>19xx</code>.

It really drives the song's tense nature. Unfortunately, the arranged version of Countdown from the 2023 remaster completely removes this lead instrument. <p>To my surprise, all the music files in the remaster are completely unencrypted, uncompressed WAVE files (The devs should've compressed them, they could have reduced the file size of the music from ~675 MB to ~63 MB). This made it very easy to modify the "Countdown" arrangement to include that lead instrument. <!--IfThisCommentIsNotPresent, <strong>WillBeOpenAndAllPageTextWillBe<strong>.FixThis-->...</article><div class=pnav><a class="btnlink fri" href=/Home/page/2/>Older Posts</a></div>
