<article><h1><a href=/2022/10/24/Kirby-Super-Star-Ultra-Everything-Unlocked-Save-File>Kirby Super Star Ultra Everything Unlocked Save File</a></h1><time>24 October 2022</time><p>I had trouble finding a 100% save file for this game online, so I'm uploading mine!
<p>Actually, <a href="Kirby Super Star Ultra (USA).sav.zip"></a>my save file</a> is only at 92% completion, but it should have most of the content unlocked. You can also use the <a href=https://www.neoseeker.com/kirby-super-star-ultra/action_replay/ds/ target=_blank>Action Replay cheat code</a> <code>1205C170 0000ffff</code> to unlock all movies.
<p>Are you wondering why I was looking for a 100% save file? If you look in the Kirby tag, you'll find out what I was working on...
<p>Update 11/8/2022: Speedrun.com has a 100% save file for the Japanese version: Kirby Ultra Super Deluxe, under the "Resources" tab. This website also has a guide on how to import the save file into Desmume due to the file being in the uncommon .duc format. <a href="Hoshi no Kirby Ultra Super Deluxe (Japan).sav.zip"></a>Here is the same save file converted into the universal .sav format</a>.</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons)>Updated Orchid Theme for WiiFlow Lite (and Wii U Icons)</a></h1><time> 7 October 2022</time><!--<a href=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons) tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons)/../P1054457-3.webp alt="Screenshot of WiiFlow's game menu with the Orchid theme."></a>--><a href=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons) tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons)/../P1054458-2.webp alt="Screenshot of WiiFlow's home menu with the Orchid theme."></a>
<p>WiiFlow is an app that displays Wii and GameCube <!--disc images-->games in a pretty coverflow view. The app used to have a wide variety of themes to customize its appearance to your liking; but as WiiFlow gained new features that required new UI elements, the themes were not updated.
<p><a href=Orchid-updated.zip>I put in a little bit of work to update the Orchid theme</a> to support the latest version of WiiFlow. It's still very incomplete; most of the settings menu will not display correctly, but the main menu and frequently used settings are functional. I also changed the "USB" icon to a "Wii" icon. I hope you enjoy using it. The Orchid theme was created by Benjay, Jiiwah, and Roku93 on GBATemp.
<p>From the WiiFlow wiki: <blockquote>Download the theme you want and then extract its contents into the /wiiflow/themes directory.  Next time you load WiiFlow go to the config menu and you should be able to change the Theme from DEFAULT to whichever theme you have added.</blockquote>
<p>I also have <a href=WiiFlow-Orchid-WiiUMenu-Banner.7z>images for a shortcut to Wiiflow on the Wii U menu</a>.
<p>On a Haxchi Wii U: install <a href=https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-wiiu2hbc-a-hbl2hbc-forwarder-channel.455991/ target=_blank>WiiU2HBC</a> and <a href=https://gbatemp.net/threads/hbl2hbc-v1-1-boot-from-wiiu-hbl-into-vwii-hbc.455673/ target=_blank>HBL2HBC</a>. You can replace WiiU2HBC's icon with my custom WiiFlow icons after installing. I recommend using <a href=https://github.com/Random06457/Wii-U-Title-Boot-Editor target=_blank>Wii U Title Boot Editor</a>. If Wii U Title Boot Editor does not work for you, use the files in the folder "tga-files" and transfer them to the shortcut's meta folder via ftp (be careful when doing this! View the Wii U's tga files to make sure you have the correct title).
<p>(The above steps apply <em>only</em> to Haxchi. I do not know how to make a Wii U Menu to WiiFlow shortcut that uses these custom images for Aroma)</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/10/05/Top-5-Games-for-Game-Design-Class>Top 5 Games for Game Design Class</a></h1><time> 5 October 2022</time><p>I don't spend a lot of time thinking about what makes the games I play good, so I'm a bit nervous about making this list. These aren't neccessarily my top five favorite games of all time; these are just the top five games that I could think of something interesting to say about. <h2>Splatoon 3</h2> <p>I really like the movement in this game. You feel fast when moving in the ink (I notice the game has this dash line effect at the edge of the screen to make this feeling...</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/09/29/Splatoon-3-Deletes-Replays-After-an-Update>Splatoon 3 Deletes Replays After an Update</a></h1><time>29 September 2022</time><a href=/2022/09/29/Splatoon-3-Deletes-Replays-After-an-Update tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/09/29/Splatoon-3-Deletes-Replays-After-an-Update/../P1054413.webp alt="Photo of a Switch screen displaying the message There are no battle replays that can be replayed."></a>
<p>Fun fact: Just like Smash Ultimate and Smash 4, Splatoon 3 will delete all your replays after an update! And unlike the Smash games, there is <strong>no way to save them before they're deleted!</strong> Wow!
<p>I set up my tripod and camera above my switch to record my replays and preserve them that way, but this photo is all I have for my efforts. Once an update is available, Splatoon 3 <em>will not</em> let you enter the lobby without updating, after which your replays will be deleted.</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/09/28/How-to-Change-the-Internal-Name-of-a-Wii-or-GameCube-Disc>How to Change the Internal Name of a Wii or GameCube Disc</a></h1><time>28 September 2022</time><p>Those who use WiiFlow or other such USB loaders to play their Wii and GameCube games may wish to change the name used for the game in the menu; to type in a name that looks more aesthetically appealing, or to distinguish between modified copies of the same game.</p>

<p>To change the name of a Wii or GameCube disc, open the game in a hex editor, locate the current name, then overwrite it by typing in your new name. This is the most reliable way to change the name of a disc.</article><div class=pnav><!--The Japanese version of this webpage gets ALL of its content from THIS page.
