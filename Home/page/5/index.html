<article><h1><a href=/2022/11/15/Kirby-Star-Allies-Assignment-Production>Kirby Star Allies Assignment: Production</a></h1><time>15 November 2022</time><p>Kirby Star Allies was developed by HAL Laboratory and published by triple A game company Nintendo. Its game engine is unknown, but people speculate that Star Allies' engine is built off of 2011's Kirby's Return to Dreamland's and 2016's Kirby Planet Robobot's engine due to the similarities between these games; its name is believed to be "Mint"<!--https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Mint_Leaf#Trivia-->. The engine may go back even further; to the <a href=https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_for_Nintendo_GameCube target=_blank>cancelled Kirby GameCube game</a> that started development shortly after the completion of 2000's Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards.

<p>Hello! When I used bsnes for the first time on my new laptop, I noticed that setting the shader to CRT-Royale just gave me a black screen (several other shaders also had weird issues). Looking at shader-related issues on bsnes's github page suggested that a faulty graphics driver was to blame. I tried switching from "Game-Ready Drivers" to "Studio Drivers" in GeForce Experience, but that made no difference. Then, I was struck by an idea, what if the problem was caused by my computer using integrated graphics for bsnes instead of the NVIDIA card? I used the NVIDIA Control Panel to switch bsnes from the automatic selection of integrated graphics to the NVIDIA card, and voilÃ ! All the shaders work perfectly! I hope this story helps you, reader. <img loading=lazy src=/emoji/ðŸ˜Š.svg alt=ðŸ˜Š></article><article><h1><a href=/2022/11/04/How-to-Convert-from-WebP-or-SVG-to-Formats-like-PNG-and-GIF>How to Convert from WebP or SVG to Formats like PNG and GIF</a></h1><time> 4 November 2022</time><p>Online Converters:

<p>Offline Converters:
<p>Just use <a target=_blank href=https://imagemagick.org/>ImageMagick</a>. It's a command-line tool, but converting is easy.
<p>The easiest way is to run <a href=https://github.com/Thysbelon/webp2common target=_blank>this webp2common script</a> in the same folder as the WebPs you want to convert (after installing imagemagick)
<p>When installing ImageMagick on Windows, make sure you leave "add to system path" checked <img loading=lazy src=/emoji/âœ”.svg alt=âœ”>. This allows you to use the program without needing to type the full file explorer path to ImageMagick every time (and it allows the webp2common script to function)
<p>I will also tell you how to use ImageMagick on its own. On Windows, you can open a terminal by navigating to the folder your WebPs are stored in using File Explorer, then shift + right-click on an empty spot, then click "Open in PowerShell" or "Open in Command Prompt".
<p>To convert a single image: <code>magick input.webp output.png</code> or <code>convert input.webp output.png</code>
<p>To convert all webp images in the directory to png: <br><code>mogrify -format png *.webp</code>
<p>On Windows: <code>magick mogrify -format png *.webp</code>
<p>Do note that <em>animated</em> WebPs converted to png will be output as many still png images, <em>not</em> an animated png. To convert animated webps to an animated image format, use <code>apng</code> or <code>gif</code>. Before converting to apng, check your version with <code>magick -version</code>, any below 7.1.10-20 will incorrectly speed up or slow down the output; the only workaround is to fiddle with the <code>-delay</code> option for each animated image.
In order to batch convert many webp images to png for static images and gif for animated images, please use <a href=https://github.com/Thysbelon/webp2common target=_blank>the webp2common script</a>.
<h2>How to Convert SVGs</h2>
<p>To convert all SVG images to png with transparent backgrounds: <br><code>mogrify -background none -format png *.svg</code> (<strong>errors may appear even if the program works correctly</strong>). Remember that on Windows you need to add "magick" to the start of the command.
<p>The quality of svg to png conversions can be improved by adding <code>-density 400</code> to the command (after "mogrify"). Play around with the amount of density until you are happy with the result.
<h2>How to Use ImageMagick on Android</h2>
<p>ImageMagick can be used on Android via <a target=_blank href=https://termux.dev/en/>Termux</a>.
<ul><li><a target=_blank href=https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-setup-storage>Follow this guide to allow Termux to access your phone's storage</a>
<li>Run <code>apt update</code> and <code>apt upgrade</code> to make sure the list of installable apps and installed apps are up to date.
<li>Run <code>apt install imagemagick</code>
<li>Linux Terminal tips: use <code>ls</code> to view the contents of the current directory. Subdirectories will usually be in color. Use <code>pwd</code> to show the current directory. Use <code>cd directoryname</code> to navigate to a different directory. Use <code>cd ..</code> to back out of the current directory. Use just <code>cd</code> to return to the home directory.
<li>You can use the <a href=https://github.com/Thysbelon/webp2common target=_blank>webp2common script</a> on Android.</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
<p>Some Linux distributions only have ImageMagick-6 in their package repository. If you are using ImageMagick-6, svg conversions will have incorrect black strokes. This issue can be fixed by installing inkscape.</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/11/01/Kirby-Star-Allies-Assignment-Game-Mechanics>Kirby Star Allies Assignment: Game Mechanics</a></h1><time> 1 November 2022</time><p>Kirby Star Allies follows the same formula established in Super Star and refined in the previous three Kirby games. In every game, Kirby starts out with only an inhale and slide move, but inhaling an enemy with an ability will give Kirby that Copy Ability. The Super Star formula has this defining trait: each Copy Ability has multiple attacks which can be activated with different combinations of the attack button, the jump button, and the d-pad/left joystick. <p>Kirby can make friends with his enemies by throwing friend hearts at them....</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/10/25/Kirby-Star-Allies-Assignment-Narrative>Kirby Star Allies Assignment: Narrative</a></h1><time>25 October 2022</time><p>Kirby is a platforming series that focuses on being simple and fun. Story often takes a back seat. Many of the games will have only a simple cutscene at the beginning showing how Kirby got into this mess, <em>no</em> story in the middle, then an exposition dump right before the final boss.<p>This pattern has its advantages and disadvantages; it allows the player to focus on the gameplay without interruption, and the exposition dump gets the player invested and makes the final boss more exciting.<p>After the most recent main-line game Kirby...</article><div class=pnav><a class="btnlink fli" href=/Home/page/4/>Newer Posts</a><a class="btnlink fri" href=/Home/page/6/>Older Posts</a></div>
