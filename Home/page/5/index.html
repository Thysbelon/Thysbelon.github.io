<p>WiiFlow is an app that displays Wii and GameCube <!--disc images-->games in a pretty coverflow view. The app used to have a wide variety of themes to customize its appearance to your liking; but as WiiFlow gained new features that required new UI elements, the themes were not updated.
<p><a href=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons)/../Orchid-updated.zip>I put in a little bit of work to update the Orchid theme</a> to support the latest version of WiiFlow. It's still very incomplete; most of the settings menu will not display correctly, but the main menu and frequently used settings are functional. I also changed the "USB" icon to a "Wii" icon. I hope you enjoy using it. The Orchid theme was created by Benjay, Jiiwah, and Roku93 on GBATemp. <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/wiiflowiki4/themes target=_blank>Refer to the WiiFlow Wiki for instructions on how to install themes.</a>
<p>I also have an <a href=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons)/../WiiFlow.wuhb>Orchid themed Wii U Menu shortcut to WiiFlow</a>. It requires a <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/wiiflowiki4/forwarder-channels target=_blank>forwarder channel installed on the vWii</a> to work.

<summary>Download and Instructions for Haxchi (Outdated CFW)</summary>
<p>I also have <a href=/2022/10/07/Updated-Orchid-Theme-for-WiiFlow-Lite-(and-Wii-U-Icons)/../WiiFlow-Orchid-WiiUMenu-Banner.7z>images for a shortcut to Wiiflow on the Wii U menu</a>.
<p>On a Haxchi Wii U: install <a href=https://gbatemp.net/threads/hbl2hbc-v1-1-boot-from-wiiu-hbl-into-vwii-hbc.455673/ target=_blank>HBL2HBC</a> and <a href=https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-wiiu2hbc-a-hbl2hbc-forwarder-channel.455991/ target=_blank>WiiU2HBC</a>. You can replace WiiU2HBC's icon with my custom WiiFlow icons after installing. I recommend using <a href=https://github.com/Random06457/Wii-U-Title-Boot-Editor target=_blank>Wii U Title Boot Editor</a>. If Wii U Title Boot Editor does not work for you, use the files in the folder "tga-files" and transfer them to the shortcut's meta folder via ftp (be careful when doing this! View the Wii U's tga files to make sure you have the correct title).

These aren't neccessarily my top five favorite games of all time; these are just the top five games that I could think of something interesting to say about. <h2>Splatoon 3</h2> <p>I really like the movement in this game. You feel fast when moving in the ink (I notice the game has this dash line effect at the edge of the screen to make this feeling...</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/09/29/Splatoon-3-Deletes-Replays-After-an-Update>Splatoon 3 Deletes Replays After an Update</a></h1><time>29 September 2022</time><a href=/2022/09/29/Splatoon-3-Deletes-Replays-After-an-Update tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/09/29/Splatoon-3-Deletes-Replays-After-an-Update/../P1054413.webp alt="Photo of a Switch screen displaying the message There are no battle replays that can be replayed."></a>
<p>Fun fact: Just like Smash Ultimate and Smash 4, Splatoon 3 will delete all your replays after an update! And unlike the Smash games, there is <strong>no way to save them before they're deleted!</strong> Wow!
<p>I set up my tripod and camera above my switch to record my replays and preserve them that way, but this photo is all I have for my efforts. Once an update is available, Splatoon 3 <em>will not</em> let you enter the lobby without updating, after which your replays will be deleted.</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/09/28/How-to-Change-the-Internal-Name-of-a-Wii-or-GameCube-Disc>How to Change the Internal Name of a Wii or GameCube Disc</a></h1><time>28 September 2022</time><p>Those who use WiiFlow or other such USB loaders to play their Wii and GameCube games may wish to change the name used for the game in the menu; to type in a name that looks more aesthetically appealing, or to distinguish between modified copies of the same game.</p>

<p>To change the name of a Wii or GameCube disc, open the game in a hex editor, locate the current name, then overwrite it by typing in your new name. This is the most reliable way to change the name of a disc.</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/09/21/The-Best-Mario-Movie>The Best Mario Movie</a></h1><time>21 September 2022</time><a href=https://youtu.be/JN-WCA5-Qxs target=_blank class=yt style='--ytimgurl:url(https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/JN-WCA5-Qxs/hqdefault.jpg)'><span>Cory Arcangel & Paper Rad - Super Mario Movie - 2005</span></a> <p>I saw this movie in game design class. It was an example of how game engines can be used to create art outside of video games. A lot of the other students were mocking and making jokes about it, which disappointed me. I think this movie is beautiful, it deserves more respect. <p>I worry that if I talked too much about the movie I would only be stating the obvious; so I'll keep this brief....</article><div class=pnav><a class="btnlink fli" href=/Home/page/4/>Newer Posts</a><a class="btnlink fri" href=/Home/page/6/>Older Posts</a></div>
