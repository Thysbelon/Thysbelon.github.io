Forgotten Land comes the closest, due to having a world modeled after Earth, and how minimalist the UI is. Kirby Canvas Curse also comes...</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/12/08/How-to-Take-a-Screenshot-of-a-YouTube-Video>How to Take a Screenshot of a YouTube Video</a></h1><time> 8 December 2022</time><ul>
<li>Use Firefox
<li>Right-click the video
<li>Right-click the video <em>again</em> to open Firefox's context menu
<li>Click "Take Snapshot..."

<p>This works on all videos on the web.

User interface elements use flat vector art with lots of patterns and a limited palette of solid colors; gradients are only used in backgrounds. <p>Sequence Director Tatsuya Kamiyama stated that the HD display is the reason they used a free-roam map rather than a linear one.<br><q cite=https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_Star_Allies_Channel><!--April 25th, 2018-->the Nintendo Switch™ system's higher resolution makes it easier to show a broader view...while keeping Kirby a size where you can see him clearly</q>. <p>The environments have whimsical elements to...</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/11/29/Jekyll-WSL2-localhost-0.0.0.0-View-on-Mobile-Fix>Jekyll WSL2 localhost 0.0.0.0 View on Mobile Fix</a></h1><time>29 November 2022</time><p>If you're making a website, you may want to test that website on smartphones. If you're making your website with Jekyll, you may want to run it in WSL2 to avoid any Windows compatibility issues. But what if you want to do both of these things? You may run into trouble. <p>Unlike WSL1, WSL2 is a Virtual Machine. A consequence of this is that the virtual Linux machine in WSL2 has a different IP address from the host Windows machine. So if you run <code>jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0</code>, then try...</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/11/22/Kirby-Star-Allies-Assignment-Audio>Kirby Star Allies Assignment: Audio</a></h1><time>22 November 2022</time><p>I was afraid that I would have nothing to say about the sound effects (interactive audio) in KSA. Unless a game is some really innovative musical experience, sfx is never what you remember after completing it. Most of the time, the sfx either works and doesn't call attention to itself, or it is distractingly bad. Kirby's sound effects are iconic, they're fun and cartoony and contribute greatly to the charm of the series; but because I've grown up with this series, these sounds are normal to me. Many of them...</article><div class=pnav><a class="btnlink fli" href=/Home/page/3/>Newer Posts</a><a class="btnlink fri" href=/Home/page/5/>Older Posts</a></div>
