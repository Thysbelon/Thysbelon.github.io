I thought that I would do very well at the quiz, because of how many Kirby songs I know, but I only got 66%. Then I wondered, &ldquo;Are all of these Kirby songs actually real?&rdquo; To satisfy my curiosity, I tracked down the source of every song...</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/04/09/Android-5.0-Lollipop-the-Best-Emoji>Android 5.0 Lollipop: the Best Emoji</a></h1><time> 9 April 2022</time><a href=/2022/04/09/Android-5.0-Lollipop-the-Best-Emoji tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/emoji/😊.svg style=width:initial;height:initial;display:block;float:right;max-width:250px alt="Smiling face with smiling eyes emoji."></a></a> <p>I've never been that big of a fan of most emoji. Apple popularized the the use of gradients in emoji, but I think it just looks <em>so</em> ugly <img loading=lazy src=/emoji/😕.svg alt=😕>. Gradients look nice in a background, but the moment they're put into a character design they just look tacky. The reason I like flat colors so much is because they don't have any ugly gradients, they're easy to draw<img loading=lazy src=/emoji/✏.svg alt=✏>, and they're easy to read at small sizes <img loading=lazy src=/emoji/🙋.svg alt=🙋>.<p>Lots of emoji...</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/04/03/Trouble-with-Spacing-Objects-Evenly-in-Illustrator>Trouble with Spacing Objects Evenly in Illustrator</a></h1><time> 3 April 2022</time><a href=/2022/04/03/Trouble-with-Spacing-Objects-Evenly-in-Illustrator tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/04/03/Trouble-with-Spacing-Objects-Evenly-in-Illustrator/../thumb.png class=fri alt="A hummingbird moth sitting in front of a computer and looking frustrated."></a><p>Today, I was working on the <a href=/Digital-Design/Social-Media/#Social-Media-Ads>social media ads for RCP</a> and I needed to space out the numbers in "1,500,000,000". I first clicked "create outlines" so I could move the individual digits around. I knew there had to be a tool to space them automatically, but I didn't know where it was or how to use it. Following a guide I found online titled <a href=https://maschituts.com/how-to-evenly-space-objects-in-illustrator/ target=_blank>"How to Evenly Space Objects in Illustrator"</a>, I selected my objects, then clicked "Horizontal Distribute Space" in the Align window.<br>Nothing happened. I tried again and again; Did I select the objects wrong<!--in the wrong way-->? Eventually, on a whim, I decided to ungroup the objects. It worked perfectly. Illustrator has good tools, but it's frustrating when they're so unintuitive.</article><article><h1><a href=/2022/03/29/New-Color-Scheme>New Color Scheme</a></h1><time>29 March 2022</time><a href=/2022/03/29/New-Color-Scheme tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/03/29/New-Color-Scheme/../thumb.png class=fri alt="Illustration of a hummingbird moth wearing a beret and holding a palette and paintbrush."></a><p>I spent a lot of time this week reading the <br><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility target=_blank>web accessibility tutorials at MDN</a> and trying to make my website more accessible.

I also adjusted the color palette of my website to meet the WCAG AA accessibility guidelines. I'm happy I was able to come up with a color scheme that is both more accessible, and is prettier than the one I had before.</p></article><article><h1><a href=/2022/03/28/Kirby-and-the-Lovely-Colors>Kirby and the Lovely Colors</a></h1><time>28 March 2022</time><a href=/2022/03/28/Kirby-and-the-Lovely-Colors tabindex=-1><picture><source srcset=/2022/03/28/Kirby-and-the-Lovely-Colors/../1-90.avif type=image/avif><img loading=lazy src=/2022/03/28/Kirby-and-the-Lovely-Colors/../1.jpg alt="A monochromatic painted green banner that reads Downtown Grasslands.

I love the flat color, monochromatic graphics that display during the level loading screens.
