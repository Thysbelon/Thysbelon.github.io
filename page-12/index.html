			<p>On November 6th 2021, Did You Know Gaming uploaded a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esIL1W_QBns target=_blank>video about the origins of Mew</a>. This video made me aware of an <a href=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/Iwata-Asks-Pokemon-HeartGold-Version-SoulSilver-Version/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train/1-Just-Making-The-Last-Train-225842.html target=_blank>Iwata Asks interview with GameFreak published after the release of HeartGold and SoulSilver</a>. They began by talking about how the Pokémon series became popular. Ishihara said that Mew <q>played an extremely significant role</q> in the first pair of games' rise to fame. Morimoto then stated:<blockquote>due to an unforeseen bug, Mew ended up appearing in some players’ games....

I thought that I would do very well at the quiz, because of how many Kirby songs I know, but I only got 66%. Then I wondered, &ldquo;Are all of these Kirby songs actually real?&rdquo; To satisfy my curiosity, I tracked down the source of every song title myself. I made the mistake of doing this before checking to see if...

<p>I've never been that big of a fan of most emoji. Apple popularized the the use of gradients in emoji, but I think it just looks <em>so</em> ugly <img src=/emoji/😕.svg alt=😕>. Gradients look nice in a background, but the moment they're put into a character design they just look tacky. The reason I like flat colors so much is because they don't have any ugly gradients, they're easy to draw<img src=/emoji/✏.svg alt=✏>, and they're easy to read at small sizes <img src=/emoji/🙋.svg alt=🙋>.<p>Lots of emoji use...

			<a href=/Blog/2022-4-3/Trouble-with-Spacing-Objects-Evenly-in-Illustrator tabindex=-1><img src=/Blog/2022-4-3/thumb.png class=fri alt="A hummingbird moth sitting in front of a computer and looking frustrated."></a><p>Today, I was working on the <a href=/Digital-Design/Social-Media/#Social-Media-Ads>social media ads for RCP</a> and I needed to space out the numbers in "1,500,000,000". I first clicked "create outlines" so I could move the individual digits around. I knew there had to be a tool to space them automatically, but I didn't know where it was or how to use it. Following a guide I found online titled <a href=https://maschituts.com/how-to-evenly-space-objects-in-illustrator/ target=_blank>"How to Evenly Space Objects in Illustrator"</a>, I selected my objects, then clicked "Horizontal Distribute Space" in the Align window.<br>Nothing happened. I tried again and again; Did I select the objects wrong<!--in the wrong way-->? Eventually, on a whim, I decided to ungroup the objects. It worked perfectly. Illustrator has good tools, but it's frustrating when they're so unintuitive.
