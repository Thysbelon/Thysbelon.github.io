<h2>ロゴ・デザイン</h2>
<p>To create a logo that embodies the idea of Responsible Consumption and Production, I was first tasked to trace five silhouettes from photos relating to that theme in <span>Adobe Illustrator</span>. The photos I chose are all objects that were mentioned <a href=..#Interviews>by my interviewees</a>. This is for the <i>Define</i> phase of Design Thinking. Normally, the Define phase is about defining the problems that your users experience. Instead, I am defining the images that they mentioned by drawing them. Below each silhouette is the word that I believe each silhouette communicates.</p>
<div class="gallery fs">
<div><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/earth.svg alt=Earth><p>TOGETHER</p></div>
<div><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/penrose.svg alt="The Penrose stairs"><p>PROGRESS</p></div>
<div><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/balloon.svg alt=Balloon><p>RISING</p></div>
<div><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/barn.svg alt=Barn><p>HARMONY WITH EARTH</p></div>
<div><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/forest.svg alt=Forest><p>NATURE</p></div>
</div>
<p>Afterwards was the <i>Ideate</i> phase, in which I designed five logo concepts. I had fun experimenting with type, and I tried to consider the tone that each font would give off. I think I'll use either a <span style="font:1.2em serif;">serif</span> font to show elegance and professionalism, or a <span style=font-family:sans-serif;><b>bold</b></span> font to show how serious the non-profit is about protecting the planet.</p><div class=gallery>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/2.svg><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/5.svg><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/7.svg><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/8.svg><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/9.svg><img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/10.svg>
</div><p>I used mainly the earth and the penrose stairs because I felt that they best represented the idea of progressing with human development in harmony with the earth. The first design, with the earth inside the C, is very strong, but I feel like it's already been done hundreds of times before, so I didn't pursue that idea. When I started combining the Earth and Penrose stairs, I, at first, wanted to have this logo be just an image, with the text underneath, but then I played with the idea of having small letters in the globe.</p><div class=gallery>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/11.svg>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/12.svg>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/13.svg>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/16.svg>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/19.svg>
</div><p>I realized that the small letters wouldn't be visible when the image was small, so I tried making the letters bigger, then I realized I could make them even bigger if I arranged them to fit in the negative space of the globe. I also simplified the stairs a little bit and switched around the positive and negative space after receiving feedback that I should do so.</p><div class=gallery>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/21.svg>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/23.svg>
</div><p>I then started to wonder if this logo would even be appealing to the target audience, or if it at all communicated what the fictional non-profit would be like, so I went back to the bold letters with the penrose stairs in the C, and I made it red to represent anger towards those who harm the planet. I then had the idea to put a different symbol in each letter, a set of arrows, the stairs, and the earth. The C is much wider that it is tall, so I made the other letters taller than the C so they would all be the same size and it would feel balanced. I positioned the R and the P close to the C and had them wrap around it in order to make the design feel like one cohesive whole instead of three separate letters. I positioned the C slightly lower than the baseline, thinking that this would make it a focal point and make the design more interesting.</p>
<div class=gallery>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/27.svg>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/29.svg>
</div><p>My professor suggested some changes to this design. She said to remove some of the white lines around the earth, make the C as tall as the other letters, space the letters farther apart, and position them all on the baseline. She also said to make the shape around the stairs a perfect half circle. I was unable to do this, because a half circle is not wide enough to cover the left half of the stairs, so I instead made it more of an oval shape. For the subtitle, I chose <a href=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Julius+Sans+One target=_blank>Julius Sans One</a>. The thinness and lack of serifs contrast this font to the one used in the main logo. Details of this font, such as the curve to the R, give the font a hint of elegance. The rigid, small caps style keeps the serious tone intact.</p>
<div class=gallery>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/30.svg>
<img src=/Digital-Design/Logo-Design/31.svg>
</div><p>I had two other ideas on how I could make the C more clear, and I wanted to draw them out.</p>
<p>I noticed that throughout this ideate process, I often put so much effort into my concepts that they could perhaps be considered part of the <i>Prototype</i> phase of Design Thinking. I also, during my classes, acted out the <i>Test</i> phase of Design Thinking when I showed my prototypes to the professor for feedback.</p>

<div class=pal id=pal1></div>
<p>palette 1. Used Paletton, triad. red was my main color. triad gave blue and green; colors of the earth. palette gives multiple shades of the colors, so I used those. Some of the shades I chose bc they contrasted better w the red. white is body text color.</p>
<!--<div class=pal id=pal2></div>
<p>palette 2.</p>-->
<div class=pal id=pal3></div>
<p>palette 2. Used Adobe color; analogous. red was base color. it gave brightly saturated red, blue, teal, green, and orange. I removed orange bc I wanted to stick to the earth themes w red for anger. I lowered the brightness of some colors to make them more muted and make a better background, and raised the brightness of other colors so they would be more visible.</p>
<div class=pal id=pal4></div>
<p>palette 3. The orange could be good. Orange pairs well w the red, and it could represent fire. I'm not sure if white should be considered part of the color scheme or not.</p>
<div class=pal id=pal5></div>
<p>palette 4. Going in the other direction, maybe a color scheme of 5 primary colors is too childish. This one will use mostly black and white w the other three as accents highlighing important information, or a change in information.</p>
