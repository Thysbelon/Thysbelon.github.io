			<p>Kirby Star Allies uses high definition 3D models for characters and environments. User interface elements use flat vector art with lots of patterns and a limited palette of solid colors; gradients are only used in backgrounds.
<p>Sequence Director Tatsuya Kamiyama stated that the HD display is the reason they used a free-roam map rather than a linear one.<br><q cite=https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_Star_Allies_Channel><!--April 25th, 2018-->the Nintendo Switchâ„¢ system's higher resolution makes it easier to show a broader view...while keeping Kirby a size where you can see him clearly</q>.

			<p>If you're making a website, you may want to test that website on smartphones. If you're making your website with Jekyll, you may want to run it in WSL2 to avoid any Windows compatibility issues. But what if you want to do both of these things? You may run into trouble.
<p>Unlike WSL1, WSL2 is a Virtual Machine. A consequence of this is that the virtual Linux machine in WSL2 has a different IP address from the host Windows machine. So...

			<time datetime=2022-11-22 >22 November 2022</time>
			<p>I was afraid that I would have nothing to say about the sound effects (interactive audio) in KSA. Unless a game is some really innovative musical experience, sfx is never what you remember after completing it. Most of the time, the sfx either works and doesn't call attention to itself, or it is distractingly bad. Kirby's sound effects are iconic, they're fun and cartoony and contribute greatly to the charm of the series; but because I've grown up with this...

			<time datetime=2022-11-15 >15 November 2022</time>
			<p>Kirby Star Allies was developed by HAL Laboratory and published by triple A game company Nintendo. Its game engine is unknown, but people speculate that Star Allies' engine is built off of 2011's Kirby's Return to Dreamland's and 2016's Kirby Planet Robobot's engine due to the similarities between these games; its name is believed to be "Mint"<!--https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Mint_Leaf#Trivia-->. The engine may go back even further; to the <a href=https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_for_Nintendo_GameCube target=_blank>cancelled Kirby GameCube game</a> that started development shortly after the completion of 2000's Kirby...

			<time datetime=2022-11-08 >08 November 2022</time>
			<a href=/Blog/2022-11-8/How-to-Fix-bsnes-Black-Screen-Glitches-and-Crashes-when-Using-Shaders-on-a-Laptop tabindex=-1><img src=/Blog/2022-11-8/NTSC-Mame.webp class=fri alt="A screenshot of Kirby Super Star running in bsnes. the bottom two thirds of the screen are blue and green."></a>
<p>Hello! When I used bsnes for the first time on my new laptop, I noticed that setting the shader to CRT-Royale just gave me a black screen (several other shaders also had weird issues). Looking at shader-related issues on bsnes's github page suggested that a faulty graphics driver was to blame. I tried switching from "Game-Ready Drivers" to "Studio Drivers" in GeForce Experience, but that made no difference. Then, I was struck by an idea, what if the problem was caused by my computer using integrated graphics for bsnes instead of the NVIDIA card? I used the NVIDIA Control Panel to switch bsnes from the automatic selection of integrated graphics to the NVIDIA card, and voilÃ ! All the shaders work perfectly! I hope this story helps you, reader. <img src=/emoji/ðŸ˜Š.svg alt=ðŸ˜Š>
