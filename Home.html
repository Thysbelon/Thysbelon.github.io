While playing it, I realized that it has many of the design points that I mentioned liking in <a href=/2022/01/30/Talking-About-My-Inspirations>"Talking About My Inspirations"</a>. It uses simple shapes with flat pastel colors. The pastel very nicely communicates its status as a relaxing game. The UI uses a color that appears to be black, but is actually a dark, desaturated blue, making...</article>

Yes, it had the limitation of only tracing images in black and white, but I could simply adjust the colors to work around that, couldn't I? But I realized that converting a bitmap to an SVG still takes a lot of work. Even though Image Trace does do a huge chunk for you, it...</article>

It has an innovative feature that allows players to insert their own Music CD into their PlayStation, and play a level generated from that CD. Players may use a PC emulator to play their copy of the game so they can see 4K graphics, among other things, but...</article>

There were a few times when I was writing my previous posts that I wanted to talk about video games, but I was worried that doing so would come across as unprofessional. Well, considering that the course I'm in <em>teaches game design</em>, I figured it's time to stop being so scared.</p> <a href=/2022/02/08/Talking-About-Video-Games-Now-Because-I-was-too-Scared-to-Earlier><img src=/2022/02/08/Talking-About-Video-Games-Now-Because-I-was-too-Scared-to-Earlier/../supmarioparty.webp alt="screenshot of Mario Party Superstars"></a> <p>In <a href=/2022/01/25/Designers-that-Inspire-Me>my first post</a>; I mentioned that a design can be solid on its own, but ineffective for the thing it's used for. I was...</article>

Today I'm going to talk a bit more about why I chose the designers that I did in my previous post.</p> <p>I mentioned that my favorite cover in the collection was <cite>Everything Matters!</cite>. The first thing I like about this cover is that it uses only four colors. Whenever I draw, I always try to limit the number of colors I use, and I really like character designs that use only three colors. Designs like these are simple and...</article>
