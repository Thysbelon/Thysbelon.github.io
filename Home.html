I thought that I would do very well at the quiz, because of how many Kirby songs I know, but I only got 66%.

Apple popularized the the use of gradients in emoji, but I think it just looks <em>so</em> ugly <img loading=lazy src=/emoji/😕.svg alt=😕>. Gradients look nice in a background, but the moment they're put into a character design they just look tacky. The reason I like flat colors so much is because they don't have any ugly gradients, they're easy to draw<img loading=lazy src=/emoji/✏.svg alt=✏>, and they're easy to read at small sizes <a href=/2022/04/09/Android-5.0-Lollipop-the-Best-Emoji tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy...</article> <article><h2><a href=/2022/04/03/Trouble-with-Spacing-Objects-Evenly-in-Illustrator>Trouble with Spacing Objects Evenly in Illustrator</a></h2><time>03 April 2022</time><a href=/2022/04/03/Trouble-with-Spacing-Objects-Evenly-in-Illustrator tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/04/03/Trouble-with-Spacing-Objects-Evenly-in-Illustrator/../thumb.png alt="A hawkmoth sitting in front of a computer and looking frustrated."></a><p>Today, I was working on the <a href=/Digital-Design/Social-Media/#Social-Media-Ads>social media ads for RCP</a> and I needed to space out the numbers in "1,500,000,000". I first clicked "create outlines" so I could move the individual digits around. I knew there had to be a tool to space them automatically, but I didn't know where it was or how to use it. Following a guide I found online titled <a href=https://maschituts.com/how-to-evenly-space-objects-in-illustrator/ target=_blank>"How to Evenly Space Objects in Illustrator"</a>, I selected my objects, then clicked "Horizontal Distribute Space" in the Align window.<br>Nothing happened. I tried again and again; Did I select the objects wrong? Eventually, on a whim, I decided to ungroup the objects. It worked perfectly. Illustrator has good tools, but it's frustrating when they're so unintuitive.</article> <article><h2><a href=/2022/03/29/New-Color-Scheme>New Color Scheme</a></h2><time>29 March 2022</time><a href=/2022/03/29/New-Color-Scheme tabindex=-1><img loading=lazy src=/2022/03/29/New-Color-Scheme/../thumb.png alt="Illustration of a hummingbird moth wearing a beret and holding a palette and paintbrush."></a><p>I spent a lot of time this week reading the <br><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility target=_blank>web accessibility tutorials at MDN</a> and trying to make my website more accessible.
